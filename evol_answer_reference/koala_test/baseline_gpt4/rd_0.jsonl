{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banking regulations prohibit banks from using cash as capital because cash is a liability on a bank's balance sheet and not an equity investment. Capital, on the other hand, is the money that shareholders have invested in the bank and represents the ownership interest in the bank. In order to maintain a reasonable level of capital, banks are required to hold a certain amount of capital in reserve to absorb potential losses and protect depositors' money. The use of cash as capital would reduce the bank's capital reserves and increase the bank's exposure to potential losses, which is not allowed by regulations. Additionally, cash is a very liquid asset that can quickly be converted into cash, so using it as capital would not provide the bank with the same level of flexibility in generating income or making investments."}

Despite his many talents, he always found himself facing a bit of a challenge when it came to casting powerful spells. His attempts were often met with a shower of sparks, a puff of smoke, or a fizzle of disappointment.\n\nOne day, while studying his spellbook in his study, a sudden gust of wind blew through the room, sending his quill pen flying off the parchment. As he reached to grab it, a powerful burst of magic erupted from his fingertips. Instead of the expected spark, there was a bright light, and when it faded, Gandalf the Grey stood before him.\n\nManderville stared in shock as the wizard he had only read about in his books suddenly stood before him. Gandalf explained that his staff had detected Manderville's magic and had brought him to the scene of a great danger. A powerful and evil sorcerer had taken control of a powerful artifact, the Warlock's Bell, and was using it to control the minds of men.\n\nManderville, Gandalf, and a young warrior named Nashu set out to restore the bell to its rightful owner and defeat the sorcerer. Along the way, they faced many challenges and battled fierce creatures, but with Manderville's gentle nature and Gandalf's powerful spells, they never wavered.\n\nFinally, they reached the sorcerer's lair, where a great battle ensued. Manderville joined forces with Nashu, using his magic to create shields and barriers, while Gandalf battled the sorcerer with his staff and powerful words.\n\nIn the end, they defeated the sorcerer and reclaimed the Warlock's Bell. Manderville's transformation into Gandalf had saved the day, and with the bell's power, he was able to restore his own form.\n\nFrom that day on, Manderville was more powerful than ever. He continued to study and learn, honing his craft and using his gentle nature to bring peace and light to the world. And every now and then, he would look back on that day and smile, knowing that he had been transformed into a great wizard and had helped to defeat an evil that threatened all of existence."}

So, let’s start by introducing ourselves, I am a journalist from a leading media house and I am here to interview you because I am really impressed with your work as a Female Film Director.\n\nDirector: Thank you so much, it’s great to be here.\n\nJournalist: So, let’s talk about the issue that has been plaguing the film industry for years now – the low number of Female Film Directors. What do you think is the reason for this?\n\nDirector: I think there are several reasons for this. One of the main reasons is the lack of opportunities and access to funds for female directors. Women face a lot of barriers when it comes to breaking into the industry, and it’s really difficult for them to get their foot in the door. It’s a cyclical problem, where women are not given opportunities, so they cannot move up in the ranks and become directors.\n\nJournalist: That’s really sad to hear. And do you think the film industry is doing enough to address this issue?\n\nDirector: Unfortunately, no, I don’t think they are doing enough. There are some initiatives that aim to give opportunities to women and promote gender equality, but there is still a long way to go. It’s an industry-wide problem, and it’s going to take everyone working together to fix it.\n\nJournalist: That’s very true. So, what advice would you give to young female filmmakers who are just starting out and want to make it in this industry?\n\nDirector: My advice to them would be to never give up and keep pushing for your dreams. It’s going to be difficult, but if you have passion and persistence, you will make it. Also, don’t be afraid to ask for help or support, and don’t compare yourself to others. Everyone’s journey is different, and you have to do what’s right for you. Just keep making work and trying to improve, because that’s the only way you’ll grow and make your mark.\n\nJournalist: That’s a great piece of advice. And finally, what do you hope to achieve with your future projects?\n\nDirector: With each of my future projects, my goal is to tell a compelling story and to make an impact. I want to use my art to raise awareness and to promote empathy and understanding. I hope that my work can inspire others and help to change the world, even if just a little bit.\n\nJournalist: Thank you so much for your time, it’s been an honor to speak with you.\n\nDirector: Thank you, it’s been my pleasure."}

It is a short and powerful work that examines the philosophical concept of death and its impact on the individual and their perception of life.\n\nThe story is narrated by a friend of Ivan Ilych, Dr. Lvov, who is sitting with his dying friend. Ivan Ilych is a high court judge, and until his final moments, he continues to occupy himself with the minutiae of his work, despite being aware that he is dying. As he reflects on his life, he becomes increasingly consumed by the question of what it all means, and whether his life has been worthwhile.\n\nThroughout the story, Tolstoy presents the idea that the most important things in life are love, family, and connection. However, Ivan Ilych, being a man of his time and social status, has never truly understood these things. Instead, he has lived his life in pursuit of wealth, status, and success, all of which he has attained but none of which he truly values.\n\nAs he nears death, he realizes that everything he has worked for is meaningless without the love and connection he has missed out on. In his final moments, he grabs his son’s hand and says, “I love you, my boy” - a simple yet profound expression of the love that he has missed out on expressing throughout his life.\n\nThe story is a powerful and poignant commentary on the nature of life and death, and the importance of connection and love. It is a short but powerful reminder that it is not the tangible things we achieve in life that matter most, but the intangible things such as love, family, and connection."}

Atwater's work laid the foundation for the development of the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) and the Nutrition Facts label, which we see on food packaging today.\n\nCarbohydrates, proteins, and fats are considered macronutrients because they provide energy in relatively large amounts and are needed by the body in relatively large quantities. Therefore, their energy content has been measured and standardized, and their caloric values are used to calculate the total energy a person consumes.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that calories from foods other than carbohydrates, proteins, and fats also contribute to total caloric intake. These include vitamins, minerals, and other electrolytes, which are essential for the body's metabolic processes and are needed in small, but quantifiable, amounts. The specific caloric values for these nutrients have not been standardized, and their contribution to total caloric intake is generally not expressed in terms of calories, but rather in terms of percentages of total calorie intake.\n\nIn conclusion, only carbohydrates, proteins, and fats have been deemed to have caloric value because their energy content has been standardized and their contribution to total caloric intake is considered significant."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression.

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related concepts. Ideologies are sets of beliefs, values, and ideas that people use to understand and interpret the world around them. These beliefs are often based on assumptions that may or may not be grounded in reality. When people subscribe to an ideology, they tend to become committed to its tenets and may even become blind to evidence that contradicts their beliefs. This phenomenon is known as cognitive dissonance, and it often leads people to engage in rationalization, where they justify their beliefs with flawed arguments or by selectively interpreting information.\n\nInconsistency, on the other hand, refers to a lack of consistency or uniformity in one's behavior or thoughts. When people engage in ideological thinking, they often become rigid in their beliefs, and may become hostile towards anyone who challenges their views. As a result, they may change their beliefs, actions, or opinions to align with their ideology, even if it means being inconsistent. For example, a person who supports abortion rights may become vocal about their stance, but if they find out that the mother's life is in danger, they might change their tune and support the termination of the pregnancy.\n\nIn conclusion, inconsistency arises when people change their behavior or opinions based on new information or situational factors, while ideological thinking leads people to become committed to a set of beliefs, values, and ideas, even if it means being inconsistent. The two concepts are closely related, and can often be seen in conjunction, where inconsistency may stem from ideological thinking, and vice versa."}

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

It is commonly used to visualize and analyze the timbral characteristics of an audio signal.\n\nOn the other hand, MFCCs are a set of coefficients used to represent audio signals in a more compact way.

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " \n \n \nTheificist. Theistical response.

{"id": "koala_50", "prompt": "Mill vs Gartner\nThis case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"? Include a summary for each.", "answer": "Neither of these cases appear to fit the query \"Find me cases where the dispute involved mine leases.\" However, I can provide you with more information about mine leases and legal disputes if you provide more details or context."}

How far north will it be?", "answer": "The Moon has indeed covered every point on the Earth once, as you mentioned. However, the next point to the north that the moon will cover is not accurate as it depends on the specific location and the time of year it is. The Moon's position relative to the Earth and Sun changes over time, which affects which parts of the Earth are illuminated by the Moon. However, in general, the moonrise occurs when the moon is positioned on the opposite side of the Earth from the sunset, which is generally around sunset. So, if we consider the current date and location, the moon will cover the next point to the north, which could be anywhere in the northern hemisphere."}

While they are often highly effective in alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety, they may also cause side effects. One of these side effects is an increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\n\nIt is important to note that the decision to take one's own life is complex and multi-factorial, and is not solely attributable to the use of medication. However, in some people, the changes in mood, emotions, and thoughts that can occur while taking anti-depressants can lead to an increased risk of suicidal behavior.\n\nIn some cases, the person may have a pre-existing risk for suicide, and the medication can exacerbate these feelings. In others, the medication may trigger new or worsening symptoms of depression or anxiety, causing distress and difficulty coping.\n\nIt is essential to communicate with a healthcare provider about any changes in mood, thoughts, or behaviors while taking anti-depressants. The provider can monitor the person's response to the medication and adjust the treatment plan as needed.\n\nIn some cases, a person may need to try different medications or a combination of therapies to find effective relief from depressive symptoms.

As he flew through the cloudy skies, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Something wasn't right, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.\n\nSoon enough, his intuition was proven correct. As he and his men landed their speeder bikes, they were met by a group of residents who seemed hostile. Anakin tried to de-escalate the situation, using his Jedi powers to communicate with the locals and calm them down. But then, out of nowhere, a man appeared. He was an older gentleman, with a tall, regal posture and a long, white beard. He greeted Anakin and his men in a British accent that was so thick, it was almost impossible to understand.\n\nThe man introduced himself as \"Major\" Darcy, a Jedi who had been sent to help restore peace to the planet. Anakin couldn't believe his ears. A Jedi who spoke and acted like a 1920s British aristocrat? He had to be kidding. But as the days passed, Anakin quickly realized that Major Darcy was no joke. He was a wise and powerful Jedi, who used his charm and wit to diffuse tense situations.\n\nAs the days went by, Anakin and his men worked alongside Major Darcy to rebuild the planet, and it was all thanks to his unique approach to the Jedi code. Rather than using force and violence, he used diplomacy and charm to bring the people together. Anakin was in awe of his newfound ally, and he knew that he had met a kindred spirit.\n\nAs the mission came to a close, Anakin and his men said their goodbyes to Major Darcy and flew back to their base. They all agreed that they had seen a side to the Jedi Order that they never thought they would. And as for Anakin, he couldn't wait to share his experiences with his master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Maybe one day, he thought to himself, the Jedi would stop being seen as stuffy and serious, and people would see them for the compassionate and caring beings that they really were."}
{"id": "koala_69", "prompt": "what are the possible performance issues in a learning program on cross cultural communication", "answer": "Cross-cultural communication is a complex and multifaceted topic, and there are several performance issues that might arise when implementing a learning program on this subject. These may include:\n\n1. Inadequate coverage of cultural differences: A learning program on cross-cultural communication must address the wide range of cultural differences that exist around the world. Failing to cover significant cultural differences can leave participants vulnerable to unintended misunderstandings and errors in communication.\n\n2. Lack of contextualization: It is essential to provide participants with contextualized examples and case studies that illustrate how cultural differences play out in real-life situations. Without this contextualization, participants may struggle to apply the lessons learned to their own interactions.\n\n3. Over-generalization: When learning about cross-cultural communication, it is easy to generalize across cultures and assume that all members of a particular culture behave in a certain way. This can lead to misunderstandings and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n\n4. Failure to address power dynamics: In many cultures, power dynamics play a significant role in communication. A learning program must address how power dynamics affect communication across cultures, and provide participants with strategies for navigating these complex dynamics.\n\n5. Lack of interaction: Learning about cross-cultural communication is most effective when it involves interactive activities and discussions. Without these opportunities for interaction, participants may struggle to engage with the material and apply what they have learned.\n\n6. Insufficient follow-up: Effective cross-cultural communication requires ongoing practice and reflection. A learning program must provide participants with opportunities for follow-up and support to help them continue to develop their cross-cultural communication skills."}

Here's a basic overview:\n\n1. You, as an individual or institution, have money in your bank account or some other savings account.\n2. You decide to invest some of that money in the stock market. You can do this through a brokerage account, where you buy and sell stocks through a broker.\n3. When you buy a stock, you are actually purchasing a small ownership stake in the company. The price of the stock reflects the company's value, which is determined by various factors like its performance, assets, and future prospects.\n4. As the company grows and its value increases, the price of its stocks also rises. This means that if you hold onto your stock, you will make money when you sell it.\n5. When you sell your stock, the money you receive is what is called the \"proceeds\" of the sale. This money is then returned to your bank account or other savings account.\n6. The money you receive from selling the stock can then be reinvested in the stock market, or it can be spent on other things.\n\nIn summary, money flows from your pocket, through the stock market, and into the company's coffers when you buy stocks. And when you sell those stocks, the money flows back to your pocket or other destination."}

{"id": "koala_80", "prompt": "Why does warmth make you feel tired?", "answer": "Warmth can make you feel tired because it induces relaxation and lethargy. When you are exposed to warm temperatures, your body releases certain hormones that slow down your metabolism and make you feel more relaxed. This can lead to a sense of fatigue or tiredness. Additionally, warmth can also reduce blood flow to your muscles, which can cause them to feel more tired or weak. This response to warmth is known as the \"warm-weather effect\" and is experienced by many people. However, it is important to note that everyone can be different, and some people may not experience this effect."}

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a computational technique used to solve problems in engineering, physics, and other sciences by dividing a complex object or system into smaller elements or nodes, which are connected by elements or interfaces. These elements can be simple shapes such as squares or circles, or more complex shapes such as beams or shells.\n\nThe FEM is a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of structures and mechanical systems. In the context of structural analysis, the FEM is used to determine the stress and loads within a structure, and to assess its ability to safely support a given load. This is useful in the design and analysis of bridges, buildings, cars, airplanes, and other structures that must safely support a load.\n\nThe FEM is also used in other fields, such as electromagnetism, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. It is typically used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically, or to gain insight into the behavior of systems that are too complex to be modeled using simple equations.\n\nIn the FEM, the behavior of the system is modeled using a set of equations that describe how the forces and stresses within the system change as the load on the system changes. These equations are typically solved using numerical methods, which involve breaking the system down into smaller elements and iteratively solving the equations for each element. The results of these calculations are then combined to produce a complete description of the system's behavior.\n\nOverall, the FEM is an incredibly powerful tool that allows scientists and engineers to analyze complex systems and make predictions about their behavior. It has been used to make significant contributions in many fields and has led to advancements in technology, medicine, and other areas."}

{"id": "koala_84", "prompt": "Title: \"Inspiration, Infallibility, and Inerrancy: Hath God Said? with R.C. Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " [ (( ( ( ( ( ( ( ((content, (contr (contr [rout (c [subject (cor (d ((center (( ( ( ( ( (su ( [  ( inf [ ( ( of (gener of (.

{"id": "koala_86", "prompt": "when are hops added to the brewing process?", "answer": "In the brewing process, hops are added at different stages to achieve different results. The most common additions are during the boil, either all at once or in two stages called the kettle hop and the whirlpool hop. \n\nDuring the boil, the hops add bitterness and flavor to the wort (unfermented beer). The amount and timing of the addition are important, as they affect the amount of bitterness and aroma that is transferred to the beer. \n\nIf you are referring to additional additions of hops during the fermentation or aging process, this is usually done as a dry hop, where the hops are added to the fermenter or storage tank. This adds more flavor and aroma compounds to the beer without adding any fermentable sugars, which can help improve the stability and shelf life of the beer."}

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

On the other hand, computer architecture refers to the high-level structure of a computer system, including its hardware and software components, and their relationships and constraints. It involves the design and description of the system, its components and their interfaces, often in terms of abstract specifications, rather than low-level circuit details. In summary, computer organization is concerned with how a computer system is built and how its components work together to carry out operations, while computer architecture focuses on the overall design and functionality of the system."}

I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "Krishnamurti’s philosophy emphasizes the importance of being present and conscious in the moment, and his teachings could be incorporated into an aikido practice in several ways. For example, techniques could be taught from the viewpoint of embodying mindfulness and being fully present in the interaction with the partner. This would involve focusing on breathing, connecting with the center, and maintaining a clear and relaxed state of mind, rather than relying on muscle strength or technique memorization. The role of the uke (the person receiving the technique) could be to offer resistance in a way that encourages the nage (the person executing the technique) to remain calm and centered. The practice could also include meditation and other mindfulness practices, such as focusing on the sensations of the body and the movements of the partner, to help develop awareness and non-violent communication skills. Overall, integrating Krishnamurti’s teachings into an aikido practice could lead to a deeper understanding of the art as a path towards self-realization and peaceful conflict resolution."}

By studying the past, we can learn from the successes and mistakes of those who came before us, and use this knowledge to make informed decisions in the present. This is especially important when it comes to social and political developments, as understanding the root causes and consequences of past events can help us navigate contemporary issues more effectively.\n\nFurthermore, historical documentation serves as a record of the past, and plays a vital role in preserving the integrity of events and people. Without records, it would be difficult to establish the truth, and to accurately assess the significance and impact of past events. This is particularly important when it comes to minority perspectives and marginalized groups, whose histories are often overlooked or misrepresented. By documenting these perspectives, we ensure that their contributions are not forgotten, and that their legacy is properly acknowledged.\n\nMoreover, historical documentation can serve as a source of inspiration and guidance, as we look to the past to find examples of greatness and heroism. By studying the lives of notable figures, we can draw inspiration from their accomplishments, and use this inspiration to motivate us to achieve our own goals. In this sense, history has a way of bringing people together, as it provides a common link to the past, and a shared sense of identity and purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, documenting history is crucial, as it provides us with a better understanding of the past, and serves as a guide for the future. By studying the past, we can learn from our mistakes, and build a better future for ourselves and our descendants."}

{"id": "koala_135", "prompt": "i assume you are familiar with the Drake equation. Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds.", "answer": "Sure, I can provide you with estimates and error margins for some of the parameters in the Drake Equation, which estimates the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy that could potentially communicate with us. However, it's important to note that the Drake Equation is an equation and not a formula with specific values for each variable. Instead, it provides an order of magnitude estimate, meaning it can be multiplied by ten to get a range that is likely to contain the true value.\n\nHere are some of the estimates for the parameters in the Drake Equation:\n\n- R*: The average rate of star formation in our galaxy, which is approximately 70-100 stars per year.\n- be: The fraction of these stars that have planets. This is generally estimated to be around 1/2, but some researchers suggest a higher value of 1/3 or even 1/2.\n- nb: The number of planets per star that can support life. This is generally estimated to be around 2, but some researchers suggest a higher value of 3 or even 4.\n- fp: The fraction of these planets that actually develop life. This is estimated to be around 1/2, but some researchers suggest a higher value of 1/3 or even 1/4.\n- fc: The fraction of life-bearing planets where life leads to intelligence. This is estimated to be around 1/3, but some researchers suggest a higher value of 1/2 or even 1/4.\n- L: The average length of time a civilization is able to communicate with other civilizations. This is generally estimated to be 1/2 of the average age of the universe in years, which is around 10^10 years.\n\nNow, let's calculate the result of the Drake Equation, including the error margins:\n\nThe result of the Drake Equation, assuming an R* of 70, be of 1/2, nb of 2, fp of 1/2, fc of 1/3, and L of 1/2 of the average age of the universe in years (10^10), would be:\n\n70 * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/3) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (10^10) = 14,000\n\nThis result should be taken with an error margin of around 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, meaning the true number of civilizations in our galaxy that could potentially communicate with us is likely to be within the range of 14,000 - 1 or 2 * 14,000 = 28,000 - 1 or 2 * 28,000 = 56,000 - 1 or 2 * 56,000 = 112,000.\n\nIt's important to note that the Drake Equation is an estimate and not a precise calculation, and the actual values for each parameter could be different, which would result in a different result. Also, the error margins are just an estimation and the true values for each parameter could be different."}

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you [Music]<br>", "answer": "It's an excellent video with great insights from Kerwin Rae on the importance of pursuing your purpose and not just money. I particularly like how he reframes failure as a signpost that helps us identify skills, knowledge and experience gaps that we need to fill in order to achieve success.

{"id": "koala_148", "prompt": "#2. To increase the energy efficiency of windows, additional glass pane is added. In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double-pane window is generally more energy efficient than a single-pane window because of the additional air gap between the two panes of glass that provides an insulating layer that helps reduce heat loss in the winter and heat gain in the summer. However, a triple-pane window is even more energy efficient than a double-pane window because it has an additional air gap and an additional pane of glass, further increasing the insulating effect.\n\nIt's important to note that the energy efficiency of a window depends on many factors such as the type of glass, the thickness of the glass, the gas fill between the panes, the frame and sash materials, and the installation method. So, it's not possible to simply say that a double-pane window is always more efficient than a single-pane window. In fact, in some cases, a single-pane window can be more efficient if it is specifically designed and optimized for energy efficiency, using modern technology and materials.\n\nTo increase energy efficiency, it's not always necessary to add more glass panes. Other measures such as using low-emissivity (low-E) glass, installing a tightly sealed frame and sash, and using gas fills that are more efficient at reducing heat loss and heat gain can also improve the energy efficiency of a window."}
{"id": "koala_149", "prompt": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment?", "answer": "In his book, \"Ethics of Memory,\" Joshua Cohen, drawing on the work of Jacques Derrida, suggests that “we must learn to think with the past, to learn from it, and to be responsible to it.” This statement is particularly relevant when discussing the ideas of Frantz Fanon, Slavoj Žižek and Shlomo Sand surrounding the question of the American Jewish Establishment.\n\nFanon, in his book “The Wretched of the Earth” argued that for a colonized people to gain freedom, they must first of all destroy the “myth of the ‘Chosen People,’” which he saw as a tool used by the Jewish community to maintain their dominant position in society. For Fanon, the idea of the “Chosen People” legitimized the oppression of others, and the denial of the rights of other peoples.\n\nŽižek, in his book “The Ticklish Subject,” draws on Fanon’s notion of the “colonized” to argue that there is a “surplus” of the Other in the contemporary Western subject, which results from the “traumatic” experience of the Holocaust. This trauma generates a need to repeat it - to re-enact it - in a symbolic sense. He suggests that this drive to repeat the trauma is what fuels the support for Israel, as it allows the West to symbolically reenact its guilt through its support for the state.\n\nSand, in his book “The Invention of the Jewish People,” argues that the idea of the “Chosen People” and the “Promised Land” is a modern construct, and that the Jewish people have no historical continuity in the land of Israel. He suggests that the idea of the Jewish people as a “nation” is a result of nationalist ideologies that emerged in the 19th century, and that it is historically inaccurate to view the Jewish people as a “people” in the same way as other nations.\n\nThese ideas, while stemming from different theoretical perspectives, echo one another in their challenge to the idea of the American Jewish Establishment as a “Chosen People” with a divine right to a particular piece of land. They suggest that the idea of the “Chosen People” is a construct that perpetuates oppression and that the Jewish community must confront its own past and history in order to move forward.\n\nIn this way, Kahane’s ethics of violence, which calls for a reappraisal of the myths and narratives that structure society and history, echoes the ideas of Fanon, Žižek, and Sand when discussing the American Jewish Establishment. Kahane’s call for violence and change is akin to Fanon’s argument for a violent struggle against colonialism, Žižek’s argument for a repetition of the traumatic experience of the Holocaust, and Sand’s challenge to the idea of the Jewish people as a “Chosen People.”"}

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a typed programming language that is designed to be an evolution of JavaScript. It is a typed language, which means that it requires developers to explicitly declare the data type of a variable before using it. This is done in order to prevent common JavaScript errors, such as trying to add a number to a string.\n\nDuck typing, on the other hand, is a technique in object-oriented programming that doesn't require strict typing. Instead, it tests an object's ability to respond to a method or property, regardless of its actual type. This means that objects of different types can be treated as the same type if they have the same interface, or responsibilities.\n\nThe relationship between TypeScript and duck typing is that TypeScript enforces a stricter typing system, which can catch more errors, while duck typing helps to make code more flexible and extensible. For example, in a TypeScript codebase, objects that implement a certain interface can be easily typechecked, ensuring that they contain the proper methods and properties. However, if those objects are accessed through a common interface, duck typing can be used to treat them as the same type, even if they are of different underlying types. This allows for more flexible and dynamic code.\n\nIn summary, TypeScript is a typed language that combines static typing with duck typing to provide a more robust and flexible coding experience."}

{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are commonly used in the construction of buildings to increase their strength, stiffness, and durability. They are often used as reinforcements within concrete or as standalone structures, to create beams, columns, and slabs that can support heavy loads and resist damage from environmental factors such as moisture, heat, and impact.\n\nCarbon fibers are extremely strong and lightweight, making them ideal for use in construction. They are also incredibly durable, with a lifespan that can exceed 10 times that of traditional reinforcement materials like steel. This makes them an attractive option for use in buildings, where they can help to reduce construction costs by reducing the need for expensive materials and structural support systems.\n\nCarbon fibers are typically installed in buildings in two main ways. The first is as individual fibers that are woven into a fabric and used to make reinforced concrete or polymer composites. The second is as pre-impregnated or dry-laid fabrics, where the fibers are arranged in a loose mesh and then impregnated with a resin to create a strong, lightweight material.\n\nIn addition to their structural benefits, carbon fibers can also help to improve energy efficiency in buildings, as they have a high specific heat capacity and can help to regulate temperature within the structure. This makes them an attractive option for use in buildings, where they can help to reduce construction costs by reducing the need for expensive materials and structural support systems."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is a very real and significant threat that humanity must confront in the coming years. It is caused by the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause global temperatures to rise. This, in turn, causes a wide range of negative impacts, such as more frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, and other extreme weather events; rising sea levels; and loss of biodiversity.\n\nTo address this threat, it is essential that we take immediate and decisive action. This means reducing our carbon emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and investing in reforestation and other carbon sequestration measures. Additionally, we must work to reduce the impacts of climate change that are already underway, such as by preparing for sea-level rise and extreme weather events, and helping vulnerable communities adapt to the changes already happening.\n\nThe good news is that there is still time to make a difference. With rapid and far-reaching action, it may still be possible to limit the worst impacts of climate change and build a more sustainable future for all."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "This could be due to a few reasons. Firstly, when watching a TV series, you are accustomed to the characters, their behaviors, and the overall plot. This familiarity can make the viewing experience feel less effortful since you know what to expect and can easily follow the storyline. In contrast, a film has a new setting, characters, and plot, which takes more mental energy to process and follow.\n\nSecondly, TV episodes often have commercial breaks, which can provide a short break from the content, allowing the viewer to recharge before resuming the show. A film, on the other hand, does not have commercial breaks, so the viewing experience can feel more continuous, making it less effortful to watch.\n\nIn summary, the familiarity of a TV series and the presence of commercial breaks can make it feel less effortful to watch 3-hour long episodes back to back, compared to watching a single film with no break."}

You would say, 'My name is Ifemelu, Ojukwu's daughter.' And they would say, 'Welcome to America.' They would not ask you to take off your shoe or show your foot. But you would still be happy, because you would have arrived in America. And your mother told you that when you arrived there, you would be free\" (Adichie 115).\n\n3. Love/Relationships motif: \"It was love at first sight, they all said. It was love at first sight for Obinze, too. He was at a party with his friends, feeling lonely and out of place, when he saw her.

{"id": "koala_163", "prompt": "how do I appear in a video call as if I'd be actively listening while I am actually sleeping?", "answer": "If you want to appear as if you are actively listening during a video call while you are actually sleeping, there are a few things you can do:\n\n1. Use a video doorbell: Many smart home devices like video doorbells have motion detection, so if someone approaches your door while you’re sleeping, the camera will start recording. You can set it up so that it plays a pre-recorded message saying that you’re asleep and not to worry, or that you’ll be right back after checking the front door.\n\n2. Use a screen saver: You can also set up a screen saver or wallpaper that has some motion to it, like a waterfall or a forest scene. This will make it look like you’re actively participating in the call even though you’re not.\n\n3. Use a timer: Set a timer for the duration of the call so that your video feed automatically switches to a pre-recorded message, like “I’m sorry, I’m unable to take your call at the moment. Please leave a message and I’ll get back to you as soon as possible.”\n\n4. Use a green screen: If you have a green screen set up in your room, you can use that to create the illusion that you’re still present during the call. You can also use green-screen technology to make it look like you’re in a different location altogether.\n\nRemember, it’s important to be honest with the people calling you and let them know that you’re not able to participate in the call. You could say something like, “Thank you for reaching out. I’m sorry, but I’m currently asleep and unable to attend to your call at the moment. Can I take a message or reschedule a time to speak with you?”"}
{"id": "koala_164", "prompt": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?", "answer": "Temperature can affect the wavelengths of light emitted by metals through the phenomenon known as the \"Bragg peak.\" When a metal is heated, the thermal energy causes the electrons within the metal to gain energy, causing them to move faster and collide more frequently with the metal's atoms. This results in more frequent and intense collisions, which causes the metal's electrons to release energy in the form of light.\n\nThe wavelength of the light emitted by a metal depends on the temperature of the metal, as well as the metal's atomic structure. At lower temperatures, the Bragg peak is narrower and the wavelength of the emitted light is shorter, while at higher temperatures the Bragg peak is broader and the wavelength of the light is longer.\n\nFor example, when silver is heated, its atoms vibrate more quickly, causing the electrons within its atoms to gain energy. This energy is released in the form of light, with the wavelength of the light emitted being determined by the temperature of the silver. At room temperature, silver emits light with a wavelength of about 490 nanometers. As the temperature of silver increases, the wavelength of its emitted light increases, reaching a maximum at around 6400 degrees Celsius, where the wavelength is about 530 nanometers.\n\nSimilarly, the wavelengths of light emitted by other metals, such as gold, copper, and iron, also depend on their temperature, with the wavelengths becoming longer or shorter as the temperature increases or decreases, respectively."}

However, I can present some possible arguments that could be used in Putin's defence.\n\n1. Self-defense: Putin's actions as the leader of Russia could be justified under the concept of self-defense. During his time in office, Putin has been accused of numerous human rights abuses and international aggression, but his supporters argue that he has been necessary to protect Russia from external threats and to ensure the safety and well-being of the Russian people.\n\n2. Legal authorization: As the head of state, Putin has the legal authority to make decisions on behalf of Russia in line with the country's constitution and laws. Any actions he takes can be argued to have been authorized by the Russian legal system.\n\n3. Necessary measures: Putin's critics have argued that his actions have been heavy-handed and have not always been justified by the need to protect Russian interests. However, his supporters could argue that the measures he has taken have been necessary to prevent greater harm and that they have been proportionate to the threats faced by Russia.\n\n4. International context: Russia's actions on the international stage have to be viewed in the context of the country's history and its standing among other nations. Putin has been accused of aggression towards neighboring countries, but his supporters could argue that Russia has been the victim of aggression from these countries and that Putin has merely been defending the country's interests.\n\n5. Amnesty international report: Putin’s supporters could also refer to the findings of Amnesty International, which has been accused of having a political agenda against Russia. Amnesty International has been reporting on human rights abuses in Russia, but Putin's supporters could argue that these reports are biased and not based on fact.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several arguments that could be used in Putin's defence, but ultimately whether or not they are successful would depend on the facts of the case, the interpretation of the law, and the opinions of the judge and jury."}

So, imagine your body is like a balloon. Now, sometimes, tiny particles called \"inflammatory cells\" can get into the balloon and start to move around, which can make it swell. These inflammatory cells are there to help protect your body, but when they're in the balloon, it can make it look bigger. \n\nSometimes, this inflammation can happen in different parts of your body, like your lungs, eyes, or skin. When this happens, it's called \"sarcoidosis.\" It's not really clear why this happens, but doctors think it might have something to do with your immune system, which is like your body's defense system. They're still studying why it happens and how to make it stop.\n\nThe good news is that for most people, the inflammation goes away on its own, so the balloon (body) returns to its normal size. But for some people, the inflammation can be really bad, and they might need help from doctors to make it stop or go away. That's why it's important to go to the doctor if you're feeling sick or if you notice any changes in your body."}

Rational beliefs are based on facts and logical reasoning, and should be supported by evidence. Believing in something without evidence is akin to having a faith-based belief, which is not necessarily irrational, but it is not based in objective evidence. In some cases, people may hold beliefs that have not been proven true or false, and there may be insufficient evidence to make a definitive statement. However, it is still important to base beliefs on evidence and reasoning, rather than simply accepting them without question.

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " s either (ne of our ( the ( ( s for for of of ( ( c the [- ( of ( ( - (- (- ( ( ( - s ( - -- in ( - ( of – - of ( of of of of of of of our ( of-c of ( of of ch of and [-t-t-c- [-lo of the ( - d - ( ( of of of of of, of of of of of of of of of - of of ‘-d of of of of - of (c of it and and in - it it, it it – it it, (ap (c of of of of of of of of of of ( of-th of (ll of ((– of of of of of of the of of of of of of [c of – (ne co of ( it [ink [if of [in of of of of of ( of of (of of of of of of of of of of of of of m of of of of of of of of of of of of of c of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of (m of of of of of of of of - of of of of of of in of - of (so of (ist of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of (h of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of and of of of of of in of [- of [-c of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of c of of of of of of d [c of [t [c (ism d-un of: of [ink is (t of [-c and [ities is of of of it of of of ad of of and of of—A of [ne-c of of our of of of ( of of of of of-of of of of of of (lo ofne [eb of – of of of of of of of of of of of of of of-ink of of of [c of ( of ( of of n of of [ (-lo [* of as of ((-H ( ( ( (ink (h sne of ( of Tist ( of or of ( of of of of of of of of l of ( of ( of ( of c of ( of ( of of over ( of of of of of of of of of of ( of [our of our h [ve of d in out hist [h d-sur-wh ( [- [eme ( * ( of of of of of of of of people of our, ines, ( ( d of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of – of of ( of and of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ll of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of-f-de-ink of d-da ‘-do (it (d of-t of of of H of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of [’ of H of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of and of of of for of l for of of for of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of  and of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of it of in of d of of [ of ["}

A Test Case is a part of a Goal, which is associated with a Project. Projects, Goals, and Tests are the main entities that define the scope of the test automation tool, while Test Executions are the result of running the tests defined in the Goal. Each Test Execution has a passed and failed status indicating whether the test case was executed successfully or not."}
{"id": "koala_179", "prompt": "How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table?", "answer": "To calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table, you need to multiply the number of rows by the number of columns. In this case, the table has 3 rows and 4 columns, so the calculation is:\n\n3 x 4 = 12\n\nThere are 12 variations on the 3x4 table."}
