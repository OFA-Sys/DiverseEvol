{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Bank uses cash as a buffer for potential losses for several reasons:\n\n1. Cash is a liquid asset that can easily be converted into cash and is readily available for withdrawal by customers. This makes it easier for banks to meet their customers' immediate demands for cash, even in the event of a sudden surge in demand.\n\n2. Cash is considered a low-risk asset since it does not have any credit exposure. Banks can therefore hold a higher proportion of cash as capital without taking on any additional risk. This in turn allows the bank to lend more money to customers and earn higher returns.\n\n3. Cash is a cost-effective form of capital since it does not require any investment or collateral to be held. A bank can use cash to meet its capital requirements at a much lower cost compared to other forms of capital such as equity or debt.\n\nIn summary, cash can act as a buffer for potential losses for banks because it is a liquid asset, low-risk, and cost-effective."}

Thank you for taking the time to talk to me.\n\nDFD: It's my pleasure, JR.\n\nJR: Can you tell me a little about yourself, and how you got into the film industry?\n\nDFD: Sure. My name is Jane Doe. I was always interested in filmmaking, and I studied it at university. After graduating, I started working as an assistant director, and I learned a lot about directing from that experience. Eventually, I got the opportunity to direct my own film, and that's what I've been doing ever since.\n\nJR: That's an impressive journey. What do you think the film industry could be doing to promote more female directors?\n\nDFD: The film industry is a male-dominated field, so there's certainly room for improvement in terms of supporting and promoting female directors. Some of the things that could be done include providing more opportunities for female directors, offering mentorship programs, and creating networks that women can turn to for support and advice.\n\nJR: Do you think the lack of female representation in film is a problem?\n\nDFD: Yes, I do. Representation in film is important, because it helps shape people's perceptions of the world around them. When women are underrepresented in film, it can send the message that their stories and voices aren't valued.\n\nJR: Do you think the problem is getting better, or is there still a long way to go?\n\nDFD: Unfortunately, I think the problem is still pretty significant. There are more female directors working today than there were in the past, but there's still a long way to go before we see real gender parity in the industry.\n\nJR: What do you think can be done to change that?\n\nDFD: I think it will take a combination of efforts, from within the industry and from outside of it. It's important for studios, networks, and production companies to take steps to promote female directors and increase diversity in their hiring practices. At the same time, we as an audience also have a responsibility to support female directors by seeking out films directed by women and giving them our attention and our money.\n\nJR: That's a good point. Do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n\nDFD: Yes, I do. I believe that it's important for women to see themselves represented onscreen, and I hope that by increasing the number of female directors working in film, we can help change the narrative and empower the next generation of filmmakers, both female and male."}

In this essay, we present a case study of a water safety engineering project in a rural town that aimed to mitigate the risk of flooding. We start by providing an overview of the problem and its impact, followed by an introduction to water safety engineering and its role in disaster risk management. Next, we delve into the design of the flood mitigation system, including the selection of the strategy, site analysis, and design considerations. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the challenges faced during the project, the impact of the system, and recommendations for future projects.\n\nIntroduction: Floods are one of the most common and destructive natural disasters occurring around the world. In 2019, the United Nations released a report stating that floods resulted in 124 deaths and caused $63.7 billion in economic losses globally. In developing countries, the impact of floods can be devastating, as many lack the resources to prepare for or recover from these events. \n\nIn this essay, we present a case study of a water safety engineering project in a rural town that aimed to mitigate the risk of flooding. Water safety engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering that focuses on the design, construction, and maintenance of water systems to ensure public safety. This includes the analysis and design of flood protection systems, such as dams, levees, and floodwalls. \n\nThe objective of this project was to develop a flood mitigation system that would protect the town from future floods and minimize the potential for loss of life and property. We begin by providing an overview of the problem and its impact, followed by an introduction to water safety engineering and its role in disaster risk management. Next, we delve into the design of the flood mitigation system, including the selection of the strategy, site analysis, and design considerations. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the challenges faced during the project, the impact of the system, and recommendations for future projects.\n\nFlood Risks in the Town\n\nThe town was located in a low-lying area near a river and was prone to flooding during heavy rainfall. The river would overflow its banks, inundating nearby areas and causing significant damage to infrastructure and property. The floods often occurred with little warning and resulted in the evacuation of residents and businesses. \n\nIn recent years, the frequency and severity of floods in the town had increased, leading to a growing concern among the community. Many homes and businesses were at risk of flood damage, and there was a potential for loss of life in the event of another flood. The town was in need of a flood mitigation system to protect its residents and property.\n\nRole of Water Safety Engineering\n\nWater safety engineering is a crucial component of disaster risk management. It involves the analysis and design of systems to minimize the risk of flooding and protect the public. This includes the design of flood protection systems such as dams, levees, and floodwalls, as well as the implementation of flood warning systems and evacuation plans. \n\nThe objective of water safety engineering is to balance the needs of society with the potential risks of flooding. It involves a multi-disciplinary approach, bringing together expertise from various fields including civil engineering, hydrology, and geography. The design process involves careful analysis of the water system, the potential hazards, and the risks to the public. It also involves the consideration of social, economic, and environmental factors, to ensure that the flood protection system is both effective and acceptable to the community.\n\nThe Design Process\n\nThe first step in the design process was to conduct a site analysis to identify the flood risks in the town. This involved analyzing the topography, hydrology, and stormwater management of the area to understand the potential for flooding. This information was used to develop a flood risk map, which showed the areas at risk of flooding during different flood scenarios. \n\nNext, the project team considered various flood protection strategies to mitigate the risk of flooding in the town. These included the construction of a floodwall to protect low-lying areas, the implementation of flood warning systems, and the improvement of the stormwater management system. Finally, the design of the flood protection system was refined based on the site analysis and the flood protection strategy."}

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "Instance segmentation is a popular and challenging task in computer vision, and achieving high accuracy can be difficult. One approach to improve segmentation performance is to leverage human knowledge about the scene or image. Here are some tips to consider:\n\n1. Define your target class: Before starting, it is important to define the target class of the segmentation. This can help focus your attention on the relevant details within the image. For example, if the image is of a landscape, the target class could be \"ground\" or \"sky\".\n\n2. Use bounding boxes or masks: Bounding boxes or masks can help highlight the area of interest for segmentation. This can be particularly useful when the class is a specific object or part of the image, such as a tree or a person's face.\n\n3. Use semantic segmentation: Semantic segmentation allows you to classify objects and their parts within an image. This can be more accurate than instance segmentation, as semantic segmentation takes into account the context of the image.\n\n4. Use ImageNet: ImageNet is a large-scale visual recognition database that includes millions of labeled training images. It can be used to improve segmentation performance by providing additional training data and labels.\n\n5. Use pre-trained models: Pre-trained models, such as those from VGG, ResNet or Inception, can provide a good starting point for segmentation. These models have been pre-trained on large-scale image datasets, and can be fine-tuned for your specific task.\n\n6. Use post-processing techniques: Post-processing techniques, such as non-maximum suppression or object proposals, can help to improve the accuracy of the segmentation results.\n\n7. Use additional data sources: Segmentation is often data-dependent, so having access to additional data sources, such as labeled instance or semantic segmentation data, can help improve your results.\n\n8. Use a multi-task learning approach: Multi-task learning allows you to combine multiple tasks into a single model. This can improve segmentation performance by providing additional context and cross-information between tasks.\n\nIn summary, incorporating human knowledge, using pre-trained models, post-processing techniques, and additional data sources can help improve instance segmentation accuracy."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " �ct co (un in and ​ can more ­ ex ​  in (c and and (and and"}

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related concepts. Ideological thinking is the tendency to hold strong beliefs based on ideology, rather than on logic or evidence. Many ideologies are based on rigid systems of thought that emphasize consistency and discourage critical thinking. As a result, people who adhere to ideologies may be reluctant to change their beliefs or admit that their ideology is incorrect, even in the face of evidence. This can lead to inconsistency in their beliefs and actions, as they cling to their ideology despite evidence to the contrary. For example, a person who strongly supports the death penalty may argue for it based on the belief that it is a deterrent to crime, despite evidence that suggests otherwise. Similarly, a person who supports environmental protection may oppose renewable energy sources like wind or solar power, despite the fact that these sources are more sustainable than fossil fuels. In both cases, the ideology of the person is preventing them from being consistent in their beliefs and actions."}

It's not uncommon to see users give gold to admins in the subreddit's sidebar or comments section, or as a private message. This can be for a variety of reasons, including the administration's fair handling of conflicts or modding, their efforts to keep the subreddit active or interesting, or even their personal responses to users' posts or comments. Additionally, some admins may choose to sell their gold for real money, using the proceeds to buy server upgrades, pay for advertising, or even donate to charity. In general, Reddit Gold is a way for admins to earn a small monetary reward or acknowledgement for their work, and many users are happy to give it to them."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " \nReading the processive.\n[ \n\n \ninical\n\nReading (newistical (​ \nPlease \n..."}
{"id": "koala_50", "prompt": "Mill vs Gartner\nThis case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"? Include a summary for each.", "answer": "The two cases that are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases\" are Smith vs Mill Company and Gartner vs Baker.\n\nIn Smith vs Mill Company, the case involved a dispute over the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground.

At the most recent time of a moonrise, the moon is going to cover the next point to the north. How far north will it be?", "answer": "Based on the current phase of the moon, we can calculate approximately where it will be at the next time of a moonrise. At the moment, the moon is in its waxing crescent phase, meaning that it's covering less than 50% of the sky. In two weeks, the moon will be in its first quarter phase, meaning that it will cover approximately 50% of the sky. At that point, the moon will be in the sky for approximately 4 hours. During that time, the moon will move about 50 arc degrees, meaning that it will have covered an area of the sky that is approximately 10 degrees wide. At the next time of a moonrise, the moon will be in the northern sky, so it will be covering the next point north of where it is now. At its current position, the next point north is approximately 10 degrees north of east. So, at the next time of a moonrise, the moon will be covering a point that is approximately 10 degrees north of east."}

{"id": "koala_59", "prompt": "How can anti-deressants make people think or act suicidally? Suicidal thoughts or actions' are a side effect of every single anti-depressant I've seen. Is the medicine controlling your mind or something?", "answer": "Anti-depressants can cause a wide range of side effects, including an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. These medications work by regulating the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin and norepinephrine. Imbalances in these neurotransmitters are thought to contribute to depression and other psychiatric disorders. However, it is still unclear exactly how these medications can cause suicidal thoughts or behaviors, as several mechanisms may be involved.\n\nOne potential explanation is that anti-depressants can alter mood, behavior and thinking, and may lead to feelings of distress or increased risk-taking behaviors. This can trigger suicidal thoughts or actions in some individuals. Additionally, anti-depressants may alter the function of the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for decision making and impulse control. This can make it more difficult for individuals to think clearly or make sound decisions, potentially leading to suicidal behavior.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that some individuals who are depressed may have an increased risk of suicide in the first place. Taking an anti-depressant may increase the likelihood of a suicide attempt for these individuals, as the medication can worsen their depression and/or lead to other side effects that can contribute to suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\n\nUltimately, it is important to discuss any suicidal thoughts or behaviors with your doctor, as these medications may need to be adjusted or discontinued. Additionally, there are several other treatment options for depression and other psychiatric disorders, many of which do not have this side effect."}

Additionally, there was no evidence of an acute inflammatory reaction or demyelination, as there was no increase in the amount of fluid around the nerve fibers, which would be present if there was an acute inflammatory process or demyelination.\n\nIn terms of white matter changes, there was a paucity of posterior le periventricular white matter, which is the most superficial layer of white matter, and the ex vacuo dilatation of the occipital horn of the le lateral ventricle, which is the largest and deepest ventricle in the brain, suggests that there has been a disruption in the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricular system. This disruption could be due to a number of factors, including an inherited condition or a traumatic injury, or it could be due to a more chronic process such as normal aging or a neurodegenerative disease.\n\nThe increased FLAIR signal is also noticeable, and this is a type of MRI signal that is associated with the presence of abnormalities in the white matter, such as chronic inflammation, demyelination or previous damage to the white matter. However, the foci of increased signal are not widespread and are not present in all of the white matter, so it is unclear what is causing this increase in signal. It could be due to a more chronic process such as normal aging or a neurodegenerative disease, or it could be due to a more acute process, such as a recent stroke or other type of brain injury.\n\nThe pituitary gland and midline structures appear to be unremarkable, with no discrete pituitary mass, cyst or abnormal enhancement, which suggests that there is no pituitary tumor or other abnormality within the pituitary gland. Additionally, the bone marrow signal is within normal limits, which means that there is no abnormality within the bones that could be affecting the production of blood cells.\n\nThe orbits and globes appear to be unremarkable, with no abnormalities seen within the eyes or the surrounding structures. Additionally, there has been bilateral cataract eye surgery, which suggests that any changes in the eyes or surrounding structures have been due to the cataracts, rather than any underlying neurologic abnormalities.\n\nNo mass effect, midline shift or extraaxial fluid collection was detected, which means that there were no changes in the position of the brain or the amount of fluid around the brain, suggesting that there was no significant injury to the brain or any significant build-up of fluid around the brain.\n\nNo abnormal enhancement was present, which means that there were no areas of active inflammation or other abnormalities within the brain that could be visualized on the MRI scan.\n\nIn summary, the findings from your MRI suggest that there was no acute hemorrhage or acute inflammatory reaction, and that there were no widespread changes within the white matter of the brain. Additionally, there were no mass effects or other abnormalities within the brain, and there was no evidence of a pituitary tumor or other abnormality within the pituitary gland.

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a computational technique used to solve engineering problems. It is an alternative to the more commonly used Finite Difference Method (FDM) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). FEM is an excellent tool for analyzing complex structures, as it allows for the modeling of the behavior of materials with different physical properties.\n\nFEM works by dividing the problem domain into a finite number of elements, each of which represents a small portion of the original domain. These elements can be triangles, squares, or any other geometric shape, depending on the problem and the specifics of the FEM algorithm being used. The behavior of the problem is then modeled within each element using a set of equations known as the finite element equations. The solution to these equations provides an approximation of the solution to the original PDE.\n\nThe finite element equations are often derived from the PDE by discretizing the partial derivatives using the finite difference method. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for the efficient solution of problems with both continuous and discontinuous solutions.\n\nFEM has been widely used in a variety of engineering applications, including structural analysis, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics. It is a powerful tool for analyzing complex engineering problems, and has helped to shape our understanding of the behavior of materials in a wide range of situations."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " [-d (h (gener, [c [s, [vis [gener, [[follow [pop, [d (of (h [su (of (inf (of of (of of (of of [of of [of of of of [subject of the cont of (f of (d inc of the (gener (per [c (d (subject (se (h [c (c (d (c [p (h (c [c (t [m, (c, ([[per, [of, pro, [m, (F and, (inf, con, [fab (p, gener, [(cont (in, n, (in, [inf, (of, of of (of, of (In, [con, inc, subject, and of the, [[inf, and inf, (in, (per, and, [m, inf, inf [(inf [m ([tr [of (of of [of of of (of of (of (of (of of (of of of of of of [of of ([In (subject, [([[(in of [c [n, [d of [h (c (center of (p of (dis ((se (inn (in [(p [c (f [F (f (subject [c (w (c (N In In of [of (c (int for ha of (int of [of of (of (of (du (c of [In of (In In (J In In, or (per, (cont, (inter ([p, (f (b (j, [of, (in (p (p ([per (in (d [in (subject (the (inf (the ((In the [pr (C ([inf ([c ([c (p, of (l (of (c ((inf (th (st (character ((b ([[(of d of ((d (f (l ((de (p (h ([f [sp, (per (f (t of (f (h ((f (dis, [subject (em (c (center (d (d (c (subject (f (l (c (c (d (c, of (–(b of (of of (of of (of of (of of of [of (f, (fin, (c (inf (sur (t (th of (of of the, (per of (of of (p of (c, of (b of (main ((t (of (–[about (cont, (m (in ((de ((per (or (dis (and (d (infl (de, of, (comm (l, (c l, (int of (h of (of of of c of (in, of l of (c (d [of, of [of of (of of (dis,, ((e, ((cou ((con (in -t (or, (c of the of (of of of of (of (C, h-d (dis, c of (of of the of about (about of about of about of about of of about of (of of (of, (b, (d (t, (of, of (c, int, or, h, in, ((dis, ([t, (of, of (of of of of the (of (of ((f, the, (t, (ne, (-of (of of,, of, of, of, (or, [in, (d ((j, (c, (m, (of, (sen (of, of of (of of, of of of (of of of (of, of, (k, (bor ( ( (and (-inf, (p, (h (th (((-c of (of of of of of of of of of the of of (of of the of the of of the of of of (( ( - (F of ( (of (ale ( (-L (-p (C (of of, (([C of of of, of of of of of of of, of, of of of,, of, of of of of of of of (( ( [cont, of of, of, of, [or, of, ( [of (of of [J of (­of of, of, of of of of of, [( of, of, of of, of, of of of of of of of t, of, of, of of, of (of, of (C (–of (of (of (of, (of (of of of (of of of of of of of, (l"}

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

{"id": "koala_122", "prompt": "The sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometres. Write a formula that finds the distance between the sun and Earth. How many years will the eclipse last?", "answer": "The sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometres. Using the formula:\n\n`distance between the sun and Earth = (average distance between the sun and Earth) * (time in years)`\n\nwe can calculate the duration of the eclipse as follows:\n\n`length of the solar eclipse = (1059 km) * (12 months / 1 year) = 5.685 hours`\n\nThe formula for finding the average distance between the sun and Earth is:\n\n`average distance between the sun and Earth = (average solar radius) * (average Earth-sun distance)`\n\nThe average solar radius is 695,700 km, while the average Earth-sun distance is 149,600,000 km. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n`average distance between the sun and Earth = (695,700 km) * (149,600,000 km / 1000000 km)`\n\n`average distance between the sun and Earth = 100000 km`\n\nSo, the length of the solar eclipse will be 5.685 hours multiplied by 100000 km, which is approximately 568500 km."}

Given the range of possibilities, I'll use an error margin of 2 orders of magnitude, meaning the true value could be anywhere between 0 and 10^9. \nSo the final result, including error bars, is: \n(10^9) * (1 - 0.02) = 10^7\n\nR: The average rate of star formation in the Milky Way galaxy is approximately 0.68 stars per year. This number comes from an average of observational and theoretical estimates, with an error margin of 0.35. \nSo the final result, including error bars, is: \n(0.68) * (1 - 0.35) = 0.35\n\nfp: The fraction of stars that have planets is estimated to be between 20% and 50%. This number comes from an average of observational and theoretical estimates, with an error margin of 10%. \nSo the final result, including error bars, is: \n(0.35) * (1 - 0.1) = 0.25\n\nne: The average number of planets per star that can support life is estimated to be between 1 and 10. This number comes from an average of observational and theoretical estimates, with an error margin of 2.5. \nSo the final result, including error bars, is: \n(0.25) * (1 - 2.5) = 0.125\n\nfl: The fraction of planets that actually develop life is estimated to be between 10% and 30%. This number comes from an average of observational and theoretical estimates, with an error margin of 10%. \nSo the final result, including error bars, is: \n(0.125) * (1 - 0.1) = 0.0625\n\nfi: The fraction of planets that actually develop intelligent life is estimated to be between 0.01% and 0.1%.

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window, depending on several factors. The most important factor is the difference between the U-values of the two windows. U-value is a measure of heat transfer through a material and is used to indicate the energy efficiency of a window. If the U-value of a double pane window is lower than the U-value of a triple pane window, then the double pane window will be more efficient. However, this is not always the case. If the U-values of the two windows are the same, then the triple pane window will be more energy efficient, as it has more layers of glass for insulation.\n\nAnother factor that can influence the energy efficiency of a window is the thickness of the glass panes. In general, the thicker the glass, the better the insulation. So, if the double pane window has larger glass panes, it can be more efficient than a triple pane window with smaller glass panes.\n\nA single pane window can also be more energy efficient than a double pane window, depending on the same factors mentioned above. If the U-value of the single pane window is lower than the U-value of the double pane window, then the single pane window will be more efficient. Again, this is not always the case. If the U-values of the two windows are the same, then the double pane window will be more energy efficient, as it has two layers of glass for insulation.\n\nTo increase the energy efficiency of a single pane window, several things can be done. First, the window can be covered with an insulating film or coating to improve the thermal performance. Second, an energy-efficient window glazing can be installed, such as low-e glass, argon gas or krypton gas. These options help to reduce the U-value of the window and make it more energy efficient.\n\nIn summary, a double pane window can be more energy efficient than a triple pane window, depending on the U-values of the two windows. A single pane window can also be more energy efficient than a double pane window, depending on the same factors. To increase the energy efficiency of a single pane window, several options are available, such as installing an insulating film or coating, or using energy-efficient window glazing."}
{"id": "koala_149", "prompt": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment?", "answer": "As mentioned in class, Fanon and Zizek both criticized the American Jewish Establishment for its failure to acknowledge and address the pain and suffering of the Palestinian people. They argued that the Establishment’s silence and refusal to take action only served to further entrench the oppression and injustice faced by the Palestinian people. In his book, The Limits of Tolerance: A Challenge to the American Jewish Establishment, Kahane likewise took the American Jewish Establishment to task for its unwillingness to address the suffering of the Palestinian people and its refusal to condemn the violence of the Israeli state against them. However, Kahane’s critique was more focused on the Establishment’s failure to actively support the State of Israel and on its promotion of a ‘liberal’ and ‘pluralistic’ narrative that sought to downplay or erase the fundamental injustices faced by the Palestinian people. Kahane argued that the Establishment’s failure to take a more active role in defending Israel was not only wrong but also harmful to the State and its citizens. In essence, Kahane’s ethics of violence reflects a similar sentiment to that of Fanon and Zizek, but with a more pointed and specific focus."}

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a typed language that adds optional type annotations to Javascript code. This helps to ensure that variables are used consistently and can be more easily tracked for potential bugs or errors. TypeScript also adds additional language features, such as classes, interfaces, and generics, to provide a more robust programming model for large-scale projects.\n\nDuck typing is a programming paradigm that allows for dynamic typing, meaning that variables can be assigned any value, as long as it meets the expected behavior of the type. In other words, you can assign a string to a number variable, as long as the number can be converted to a string and the program behaves as expected. This approach is often used for prototyping and in loosely-coupled architectures, as it allows for more flexibility and decreases the need for explicit type declarations."}

{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are used in buildings in a variety of applications, including structural reinforcement, insulation, and facades. Here are some of the ways carbon fibers are used in buildings:\n\n1. Structural Reinforcement: Carbon fibers can be woven into a strong, lightweight material called carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) that is used for reinforcing concrete structures, such as bridges, tunnels, and buildings.\n\n2. Insulation: Carbon fibers can also be used as insulation materials in buildings. By incorporating carbon fibers into the insulating material, the material becomes more effective at resisting heat transfer, which can help to reduce energy consumption.\n\n3. Facades: Carbon fibers can also be used as a material for facades in buildings. By integrating carbon fibers into the surface of the material, the facade becomes stronger and more impact-resistant, while also providing a sleek, modern aesthetic."}

Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "1. American Dream/Disillusionment: There are several examples of this motif in the story, including the quote I provided above. However, one clear example is when the narrator describes the reaction of her relatives when she won the visa lottery. They told her that in a month, she would have a big car, a big house, and that she shouldn't buy a gun like the Americans. This shows that they believed that anyone who moved to America would automatically achieve the American Dream, which is not the case, and that they expected her to have certain things, such as a gun, that are not typical or expected for many Americans.\n\n2. Immigration/Identity: The narrator describes feeling like an \"alien\", a \"different species\", and feeling like she doesn't belong in America, all of which suggest that she feels like she does not belong in her new country, and that she feels like an outsider or an immigrant. She also struggles to fit in and feel accepted by her peers, which is also an example of the immigration theme.\n\n3. Feminism/Gender Roles: This story is told from the perspective of a female narrator, and there are several instances where the narrator expresses her frustrations with gender roles and expectations, including her mother's insistence that she wear traditional Indian clothing or her father's expectations that she would marry a nice Indian boy. These elements show that the narrator is questioning and challenging traditional gender roles and expectations, which is a key aspect of the feminism theme."}
{"id": "koala_163", "prompt": "how do I appear in a video call as if I'd be actively listening while I am actually sleeping?", "answer": "You can use a screen recorder, such as OBS Studio or Filmora, to record your screen and audio at the same time. Once the video call starts, start the recording, and set the screen to show the video call feed, while still recording the audio from your computer. Then, when the video call ends, use the screen recorder to edit out the parts where you were asleep (e.g. by using the trim feature to cut out the parts where you were sleeping) and save the video as an MP4 file. You can then share this video file with your video call participants, and they will think that you were actively participating in the video call, even though you were asleep."}

Iron 750 λ\n2. Copper 900 λ\n3. Aluminum 1075 λ\n4. Zinc 1175 λ\n5. Nickel 1275 λ\n6. Tin 1375 λ\n7. Lead 1575 λ\n8. Mercury 2343 λ\n9. Gold 3800 λ\n10. Platinum 4000 λ\n\nThe wavelengths of light emitted by metals depend on their temperature. At room temperature, the wavelength of light emitted by metals can range from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (deep red). As the temperature increases, the wavelength of light emitted by metals decreases, and they appear to be increasingly blue in color. At high temperatures, some metals, such as mercury, may emit light with a wavelength as high as 500 nm (violet), while others, such as gold, may emit light with a wavelength as low as 380 nm (violet)."}

The evidence against him is circumstantial at best, and much of it is fabricated or tainted in some way. Furthermore, the allegations against him are politically motivated, and many of his accusers have ulterior motives for bringing the charges.\n\nNext, I would point out that Putin has a long history of fighting corruption and working towards the betterment of his country. He has helped to modernize Russia and improve the lives of its people. Compared to other world leaders, he has a reputation for honesty and integrity.\n\nNext, I would present evidence that the allegations against Putin are part of a broader campaign by Western countries to undermine Russia and its leadership. This campaign has included various forms of propaganda, subversion, and even acts of war.\n\nI would also point out that the evidence against Putin is weak and inconsistent with his well-documented reputation for honesty and integrity. Many of the allegations against him are decades old, and the people making the accusations have changed their stories or provided contradictory testimony.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence and the context, it is clear that Putin is innocent of all charges. He is a strong and honorable leader who has done much good for his country, and he should be acquitted of all charges."}

These patches, called granulomas, can form in different organs like the lungs, lymph nodes, or eyes. While the cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, it is thought to be an immune system response to something in the environment. Symptoms can vary and may include coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, or eye irritation. The diagnosis is often made through a biopsy of an affected organ, and treatment options may include medication or, in severe cases, surgery."}

{"id": "koala_169", "prompt": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence?", "answer": "It is not rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence. Beliefs should always be based on evidence and reason, rather than mere faith or emotion. When faced with two competing claims, it is always preferable to err on the side of caution and withhold belief until sufficient evidence is available.\n\nFor example, it would not be rational to believe in the existence of aliens or Bigfoot, as there is no objective evidence to support these claims. However, it would be rational to believe in the theory of evolution, as it is supported by a vast body of scientific evidence.\n\nIn summary, rationality requires us to base our beliefs on evidence and reason, rather than blind faith or emotion."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " ([  [ [ of ne [nel (  [ (​ ( (  ( ( ( ( ( here [ ( [[ ( [-c ( and ( [ – [e ( [- [ of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of (of of [[([of ((c [(c ((c (c [ve (c [com of ( (, ( (m and (th [be (c ( ( of ( ( of g of (m w [h – (-c (c [maybe [c  [h-c it (d (c ( [tr of ( of ( ( [c ( (m ((h, ’ c of [(c [der [c of of ( of ( ( [c (  –  [c (c (de [(c [de [( ( ( ( (-c ( (f for [( ( ( [( ( [t ((  [( ( of ( of ( of ( and of (ne of an of of of [( of of of of of ( of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of [(c of of of of of of of of [c of of of, of of of of ( (ar of, of [ch [( (c of of [ne of ( of of of of of of of of ( of of in of of of ( - of of of of of of of of of of ( of if of of of (- [ of or of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of of and of of of of of of of of of of of, of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of, of ( ( of [-c of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of of of of ( of of C of of of [[ [ of ( ( and of w [[ [­ [our [cl (t [­ [ [ [[  [m of l of of of of either of [( of of ( of [m e ( ( – in [­ of l ( of (h of of of of of of L (l ( ( [e [ - ( [ ( ( ( [­ [ of ( of of [ [ C [ ( ( ( [ [- ( [ [ ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( C - C ( ( C-C ( ( ((, ( ( ( and as ( or s, ( C ( [ ( ( ( [ ( ( ( ( ( ( [( ( ( ( ( ( (, ( ( ( (,, [ –  ( of ( of of [of of of of [ ( [, ( ( [ [ ( [ ( [ ( [ [ ( ( ( ( (( ( [ ( [ ( ( ( in ( [ ( ( [ - of [ and [ - [c, and [h [( [ ( ( or of ( of or of [ ( ( ( [ of [ or of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ ( – [ ( and ( [h ( ( ( [[ of [ of [ of of ( of n of [ of of of of of of of of of of of n of of [e of of of of of of of of of of -c of ( (al ( [(en, (t -c (in,al ( (, of, [e, (-or-t ( [[ ( (  ( – of ( of of ( of of of of of of of ( of of of ( of ( of [ [ [e- [c ( [m of of [n of (, of [( of of ( of, ( ( of of ( ( [ ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of [’ ( [and, (c ( (—( in of [of of of of of of of of, of of of of ( of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of A of of-of ([ [, ( and, and, “ and in,,, L of, in, [­ of, of in of ( of C ( ( C of L of of of [ of [ of ( of of of of of,  ( and ( ( of [t of of of (( of of, of, and, of, of of of ( [– C ( ( of, N ( ( of of –"}
{"id": "koala_178", "prompt": "can you generate a data model for a test automation tool considering organizations, users, projects, goals (under projects), tests (under goals) and executions (of test cases). Each execution has a date and a passed or failed status.", "answer": "Yes, here is a data model for a test automation tool that considers organizations, users, projects, goals (under projects), tests (under goals) and executions (of test cases):\n\n1. Organization: The organization is the entity that owns and operates the test automation tool. It may consist of multiple locations or branch offices.\n\n2. User: A user is an individual who has been granted access to the test automation tool. They may belong to an organization or may be an external individual.\n\n3. Project: A project is an initiative undertaken by an organization, which has a specific objective and a defined scope. The test automation tool can be used to automate tests for the project.\n\n4. Goal: A goal is a specific outcome that a project aims to achieve. It may consist of one or more specific objectives, which can be measured or evaluated. Tests can be designed to help achieve the goal of a project.\n\n5. Test: A test is an investigation intended to reveal the quality of a system or component. It consists of a set of pre-defined actions that are carried out on the target system. Executions of test cases can be tracked and recorded in the test automation tool.\n\n6. Execution: An execution is the actual running of a test. It involves the execution of a test case on the target system according to the specified test plan. An execution can have a passed or failed status, depending on whether the test case was successful or not.\n\nThe data model shown above is fairly basic and can be extended to include additional entities and relationships. For instance, you could add the ability to manage test suites, which group together related tests. You could also add the ability to manage test cases, which define the specific actions to be taken during test execution. Additionally, you could add the ability to manage test environments, which represent the different configurations of the target system that are used during test execution."}
{"id": "koala_179", "prompt": "How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table?", "answer": "To calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table, you will need to know the range of the values that can be entered into each cell. For example, if the possible values for each cell are 1-100, then there will be a total of 100^2 or 10,000 different combinations."}
