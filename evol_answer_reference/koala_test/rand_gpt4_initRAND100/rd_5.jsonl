{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Cash is an asset on the balance sheet of a bank, and is used to cover potential losses and meet regulatory requirements. However, banks can face many risks, such as bad loans, fraud, or market fluctuations, that may result in losses. If a bank relies only on cash to cover potential losses, it may not have enough capital to absorb the losses and continue operating.\n\nBanks use various tools to manage risk, including setting lending limits, maintaining reserves, and diversifying their loan portfolios. They may also borrow money from the Federal Reserve to maintain a cushion of capital. By having a buffer of capital, banks can better absorb losses and continue operating in the event of a financial crisis."}

It was a very shy particle, preferring to travel through space unnoticed. But one day, it encountered a much larger, more energetic particle called a proton. The proton was excited by the neutrino's presence, and it latched onto the neutrino, forming an atom.\n\nThe proton and neutrino began to orbit around each other, forming a nucleus. They were so happy together, they started to sing, \"We are the nucleus, of an atom, bound together by the strong force, forever one, never to be parted.\"\n\nOne day, the proton became disgruntled with the neutrino. The proton wanted to be the center of attention, and it didn't like sharing the spotlight with the neutrino.\n\nSo, the proton started to exert more and more energy on the neutrino, trying to push it away. The neutrino, being much smaller and lighter, was easily pushed around.\n\nThe proton grew more and more frustrated, until it had built up so much energy that it split into three smaller particles called quarks.\n\nThe proton and neutrino were devastated at the loss of their friend, and they started to sing a different song, \"We are the nucleus, of an atom, broken apart, never to be whole again.\"\n\nThe quarks, now free, began to roam the universe, looking for a new partner. The neutrino was lonely without the proton, and the proton was lonely without the neutrino. They both began to search for their lost love.\n\nBut the quarks were impatient, and they wanted a partner who could keep up with them. They found a kindred spirit in the electron, a smaller, lighter particle that could easily zip around the nucleus.\n\nThe proton and neutrino were overjoyed to find their lost love, and they began to sing a new song, \"We are the nucleus, of an atom, joined together, never to be parted again.\"\n\nThe quarks and electron formed a new nucleus, this time with the proton and neutrino as the nucleus and the electron as the valence electron. The nucleus was happy again, and they all began to sing a new song, \"We are the nucleus, of an atom, bound together by the strong and the weak force, forever one, never to be parted.\"\n\nAnd so, the story of the neutrino, proton, and electron came to an end, but their story lives on in the nucleus of every atom in the universe."}

", "answer": "Once upon a time, there was a young man named Hildibrand Manderville. He was a kind and gentle soul, but his life was far from easy. At a young age, his parents passed away, leaving him with no one to look after him. He spent his days wandering the streets, trying to survive, until one day, he found himself in a dark and dank cave. He didn't know where he was or how he got there, but as he searched for a way out, he stumbled upon a strange book. It was old and worn, but when he opened it, he saw that it was full of magic. He read it eagerly, hoping to find a way out of the cave, but as he turned the pages, something happened. A strange light shone from the book, and when it faded, Hildibrand was gone, and in his place stood a tall, ancient wizard. The wizard was Gandalf the Grey, and he knew that Hildibrand could help him on his quest.\n\n\"Hildibrand,\" he said, \"I need your help to defeat an evil sorcerer who threatens the world. Can you join me on this quest?\"\n\nHildibrand was confused, but he knew that he didn't have a choice. So he agreed to help Gandalf the Grey, and together, they set off on a dangerous journey, fighting monsters and overcoming obstacles, until they finally reached the sorcerer's lair.\n\n\"Finally,\" said Gandalf. \"Here it is.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, then threw open the door and walked inside. Hildibrand followed, wondering what they would find.\n\nThe room was huge, and it was filled with evil creatures, all intent on stopping Gandalf the Grey and Hildibrand Manderville. But they were not alone. Standing beside them was a small boy, with a pointed hat and a staff in his hand. It was the Warrior of Light, and he smiled at Hildibrand.\n\n\"We need your help, Hildibrand,\" he said. \"Can you defeat the sorcerer and restore us to our true forms?\"\n\nHildibrand looked around at the horde of monsters, then back at Gandalf the Grey.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"But I'll try.\"\n\nSo together, they faced the sorcerer, and with the aid of the Warrior of Light, they were able to defeat him and restore Gandalf the Grey and Nashu to their true forms.\n\nAs they left the sorcerer's lair, they looked back at Hildibrand.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Gandalf the Grey. \"For your bravery and your loyalty, I hereby bestow upon you the title of Gandalf the Grey.\"\n\nAnd so, Hildibrand Manderville became Gandalf the Grey, and together, he and his friends continued their quest, until finally, they were able to defeat the evil sorcerer and restore peace to the world.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is the story of how Hildibrand Manderville became Gandalf the Grey, and how he and the Warrior of Light and Nashu worked together to defeat an evil sorcerer and restore order to the world."}

I've directed a number of critically acclaimed films and have won many awards for my work.\n\nInterviewer: That's amazing. Can you tell me more about your journey as a filmmaker?\n\nDirector: Sure, it's been a long and challenging road, but I'm very passionate about filmmaking, so the journey has been worth it. I started off making short films and documentaries, and then I made the jump to feature films. My first feature film was a huge success, and I received a lot of attention for it.

The story centers around the titular character, Ivan Ilyich, a government official who lives a comfortable life, but is plagued by the fear of death and a feeling of purposelessness in his life. His health begins to deteriorate and he realizes that his life is approaching its end. His death is an impending and inevitable reality, but he is unable to come to terms with it and struggles to find meaning in his existence. The story explores the themes of morality, the search for meaning in life, and the acceptance of death.\n\nThe novella begins with Ivan Ilyich lying on his deathbed. He is 54 years old and has lived a life filled with wealth, status, and success. However, he realizes that his life is a failure, and he is filled with regret and doubt. He is haunted by the fear of death and the prospect of an afterlife. He feels trapped in a meaningless existence, with no purpose or joy. He is unable to find peace or acceptance in his impending death, and his struggle to find meaning in his life becomes his final, unforgiving struggle.\n\nThe Death of Ivan Ilyich is a classic example of existentialist literature. It explores the themes of alienation, meaninglessness, and the search for purpose in a godless universe. Ivan Ilyich struggles to find meaning in his existence and to find peace with the inevitability of his death. He comes to realize that his life is meaningless and that he has spent his life chasing after worthless material things. He realizes that his achievements and status have not brought him happiness or fulfillment, and that his life has been wasted. He comes to accept that he must die and that nothing can change that fact, but he is unable to find peace or meaning in his impending death.\n\nThe Death of Ivan Ilyich is an unflinching and powerful portrayal of human mortality. It examines the fear and anxiety that come with the knowledge that death is inevitable and the struggle to find meaning in a life that is finite and fleeting. It is a haunting and emotional tale that explores the complexities of the human condition and the search for meaning in life."}

A small porcupine named Prickles is huddled up in a tree, trying to stay warm. Prickles is a shy and quirky creature, always getting into trouble with her prickly spines and her big, floppy ears. She is very curious and loves to explore her surroundings, but she's often clumsy and gets herself into trouble.\n\nToday is no different. Prickles had ventured out of her den to look for food, but she got lost and ended up far from home. She's sitting in the tree, crying and trying to gather the courage to go back to her den. Suddenly, she hears the sound of footsteps coming towards her. She stops crying and holds her breath, afraid that someone might see her. But the footsteps continue past her and she sighs in relief.\n\nJust then, she hears the rustling of leaves and turns around to see a rabbit. The rabbit is a little older than Prickles and is known for her kindness and wisdom. She stops and looks at Prickles, who is still trembling with fear. \"Don't be afraid,\" she says, \"I won't tell anyone you're here.\"\n\nPrickles takes a deep breath and wipes her tears. \"Thank you,\" she says. \"My name is Prickles. I got lost and I'm afraid to go back to my den.\"\n\nThe rabbit smiles. \"My name is Leafy,\" she says. \"I've lived here in the forest all my life, so I know the ways well. Let me help you get back to your den.\"\n\nLeafy leads Prickles to the right direction and they walk in silence, side by side. Prickles is quiet and ashamed, but Leafy is kind and patient, never once making her feel like a burden.\n\nSuddenly, Prickles stops. \"Leafy,\" she says, \"I don't want to go back to my den.\"\n\nLeafy looks at her in surprise. \"Why not?\" she asks.\n\n\"Because I want to be a seamstress!\" Prickles says, her voice full of excitement. \"I've always been good with my hands and I love to sew. I want to make beautiful clothes and quilts and blankets. I want to live in the city and sell my creations to the people there.\"\n\nLeafy looks at Prickles, impressed by her determination. \"That's a wonderful dream,\" she says. \"But you can't just up and leave the forest. You'll never survive in the city, with all the cars and people.\"\n\nPrickles frowns, a little sad. \"I know,\" she says. \"But I have to try. I can't just live my whole life in the forest, doing the same thing over and over again. I want to see the world and I want to pursue my passion.\"\n\nLeafy looks at her, touched by her bravery. \"I understand,\" she says. \"But you have to be careful. The world is a dangerous place for a porcupine.\"\n\nPrickles nods. \"I know,\" she says. \"But I want to take my chances. I want to follow my dreams.\"\n\nLeafy smiles at her. \"Then you have my support,\" she says. \"Go and chase your dreams, Prickles, but be careful. And never forget that you always have a friend in me.\"\n\nPrickles smiles at her. \"Thank you,\" she says. \"I won't forget.\"\n\nAnd with that, Prickles sets off, determined to make her dreams come true. Leafy watches her go with a heavy heart, but she knows that she will always be there to support and guide her, no matter what path she chooses.\n\nAnd so Prickles begins her journey, braving the dangers of the world and following her heart. She meets new friends, makes new discoveries, and learns valuable lessons along the way. And every once in a while, she stops and thinks about Leafy, her kind and wise friend, who helped her find the courage to pursue her dreams.\n\nYears pass and Prickles starts to make a name for herself in the city, as a celebrated seamstress. She designs beautiful dresses and quilts, and they are loved and admired by everyone. Prickles is happy and she has never"}

Prompt=  \n\nAfter reading Lalor’s Chapter 8 as well as Goode’s explanation of curriculum evaluation necessity and models, explain what your school does to evaluate curriculum. Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.

{"id": "koala_25", "prompt": "Write me a 2000 word essay on a water safety engineering project.", "answer": "Water safety engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of structures and facilities that are used for the safe storage, treatment, and/or transportation of water. It aims to ensure that water systems are designed, constructed, and operated in a way that minimizes the risk of failure, accidents, and loss of life. This essay will discuss a water safety engineering project that I worked on.\n\nIn July 2021, I was assigned to a water safety engineering project at a municipal water utility in a large city in the United States. The project required the design and construction of a new raw water intake facility to replace an aging and obsolete structure. The new facility needed to be capable of meeting the water utility's current and future demand, as well as ensure that the water supply was protected against contamination.\n\nThe water utility provides drinking water to over 1 million people, making it one of the largest in the country. Raw water is supplied to the utility through a series of surface water intakes located along a river. The river flows through a highly urbanized area and is subject to pollution from a variety of sources, including industrial, commercial, and residential discharges. The existing intake structure was originally built in 1950 and was no longer able to meet the utility's needs. The intake was located in a highly constricted section of the river, which increased the risk of clogging or sedimentation, and the structure was undersized, resulting in reduced water flows and increased energy costs.\n\nAs part of the water safety engineering project, a new intake structure was designed to replace the existing one. The new intake was located in a less constricted section of the river and was sized to meet the water utility's current and future demand. The intake structure was designed with a screen to prevent large debris from entering the system. The screen was also sized to minimize the risk of clogging. The raw water was then piped to a newly constructed raw water pumping station, where it was treated before being distributed to customers.\n\nThe water safety engineering project was a large and complex undertaking, requiring the coordination of multiple teams and departments. The engineering, design, and construction teams worked closely with the operations and maintenance teams to ensure that the new intake facility would be properly designed, constructed, and operated. In addition, the project was designed to minimize disruption to the water utility's customers, by ensuring that there was no interruption in water supply during construction.\n\nThe new intake facility was completed on schedule and on budget. It is currently in operation and is providing a safe and reliable water supply to the city's residents. The project was a great example of how water safety engineering can be used to ensure the safety and reliability of water systems."}

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "Instance segmentation is a challenging semantic labeling task that requires high level of precision and accuracy to produce meaningful and reliable outputs. It is important to note that the accuracy and precision of instance segmentation is highly dependent on the quality of the data used for training. However, while data augmentation techniques can help improve the performance of instance segmentation models, human knowledge can also be utilized to improve the segmentation results. Here are some tips to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge:\n\n1.  Visualize the data: It is important to have a clear understanding of the data and the labels assigned to the instances. This can be done by visualizing the data using tools such as t-SNE, PCA or other dimensionality reduction techniques. This will help to understand the distribution of the data and identify any outliers or regions where the data is noisy or ambiguous.\n\n2.  Interpretation of the data: Human knowledge of the context in which the data was collected can help in interpreting the data and identifying instances that may be difficult to segment. For example, if the data was collected from a medical imaging dataset, knowledge of anatomical structures and their appearances can help to identify instances that may be difficult to segment.\n\n3. Ensure data cleanliness: Before training an instance segmentation model, it is important to ensure that the data is clean and free from noise and outliers. This can be achieved by performing data pre-processing and data cleaning steps such as data normalization, data augmentation, and data imputation.\n\n4. Improving the training data: If the training data is limited or contains instances that are difficult to segment, it may be beneficial to augment the data with additional instances or labels. This can be done by using data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, rotation, scaling or flipping.\n\n5. Data masking: Data masking is the process of replacing some of the values in the training data with fictitious data. This can be used to simulate missing data and improve the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data.\n\n6. Data augmentation with human knowledge: Data augmentation techniques such as image rotation, flipping, and cropping can be used to improve the instance segmentation model’s performance. However, these techniques can be further improved by incorporating human knowledge of the context in which the data was collected. For example, if the data was collected from a medical imaging dataset, it may be beneficial to rotate the images based on the anatomical orientation of the organs or to flip the image to simulate a different view. This can improve the model’s ability to segment the anatomical structures in the images.\n\n7. Explore alternative segmentation methods: There are several alternative segmentation methods that can be explored to improve the segmentation results. For example, if the data was collected from a natural images dataset, it may be beneficial to use a graph-based segmentation method such as Graph Cut, or a region-based segmentation method such as Snakes.\n\n8. Evaluate the segmentation results: It is important to evaluate the segmentation results to ensure that they are accurate and reliable. This can be done by manually inspecting the segmentation results or using post-processing techniques such as non-maximum suppression or interactive thresholding. If the segmentation results are not accurate or reliable, it may be worth re-training the model or exploring alternative segmentation methods.\n\nIn summary, utilizing human knowledge and expertise can be an effective way to improve the segmentation results of instance segmentation models. By visualizing the data, interpreting the data, cleaning the data, augmenting the data, using data masking, incorporating human knowledge into data augmentation, exploring alternative segmentation methods and evaluating the segmentation results, we can significantly improve the segmentation performance of instance segmentation models."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " .

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Inconsistency and ideological thinking often go hand in hand. When an individual holds a set of beliefs that are ideological in nature, it can lead to inconsistency in their views or behaviors. Here are some ways in which inconsistency and ideological thinking are related:\n\n1. Ideological thinking: Ideological thinking is a tendency to form one's beliefs and make decisions based on a set of principles or values, rather than on evidence or rational thought. People who hold ideological views are more likely to become inconsistent in their views or behaviors in an attempt to remain true to their beliefs.\n\n2. Sources of inconsistency: Ideological thinking can lead to inconsistency in several ways. First, it can lead to cognitive dissonance, where a person's beliefs and actions are inconsistent, causing them to be uncomfortable and trying to resolve the dissonance. Second, it can lead to selective exposure, where a person only seeks out information that supports their ideology, resulting in a biased and inaccurate view of the world. Finally, it can lead to double standards, where a person applies different standards or criteria to their own actions and those of others, resulting in inconsistent or hypocritical behavior.\n\n3. Resolving inconsistency: People who hold ideological views often find it difficult to resolve inconsistencies in their beliefs and behaviors. This is because their ideology often provides a framework for understanding the world, and they may find it difficult to abandon or alter that framework. Additionally, people may feel a strong sense of loyalty to their ideology, and may be reluctant to admit that their views are inconsistent or wrong."}

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " 1 "}

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

The stock market is where investors come together to buy and sell shares of stock in publicly traded companies. When you buy shares of stock, you become a part owner, or shareholder, of that company. When you sell the stock, the money you receive goes back to your bank account or credit card.\n\nThe stock market operates through a series of exchanges where buyers and sellers come together to trade stock. When you buy stock, you're purchasing a share of ownership in a company. Companies issue shares of stock to raise money for their operations. As a shareholder, you're entitled to a portion of the profits, as well as a vote in how the company is run.\n\nWhen you buy stock in a company, the money you spend on the shares goes to the company. This is called \"equity financing\" and it's an important way for companies to raise money to expand their operations or take on new projects.\n\nThe money you spend on stock typically isn't used directly to support the business you've invested in. Instead, the company uses the money to fund its operations, expand into new markets, or finance new projects. The money you receive when you sell your stock goes back to the company, which can use it for any purpose.\n\nThe stock market is a complex, dynamic system that connects millions of investors, companies, and financial institutions around the world. It's a powerful tool for raising capital and allowing businesses to grow, but it's also a volatile and risky place to invest your money."}

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a computational technique used to solve engineering problems. It is a branch of finite element analysis, which is a sub-discipline of numerical analysis. FEM is a powerful tool used to analyze and solve complex problems in a wide range of engineering disciplines, including structural, thermal, and stress analysis. It is used to predict how a given structure or object will respond to loads, stresses, and other environmental factors.\n\nThe basic idea behind FEM is to break a complex problem into smaller parts called elements, and then solve each individual part separately. These elements can be two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D). The finite element approach allows for greater accuracy and more flexibility than other analytical methods, as it can account for complex geometry, material non-linearity, and other factors that are difficult to account for with traditional methods.\n\nThe basic steps of FEM are:\n\n1. Defining the geometry and mesh\n2. Creating the finite element model\n3. Applying loads and boundary conditions\n4. Solving for stress, strain or displacement\n5. Repeating steps 1-4 until a solution is obtained.\n\nIn the first step, the geometry of the problem is defined, including the dimensions, shape, and material properties. The mesh is then created, which is a tessellation of the geometry into smaller elements. These elements represent the smallest unit of the model, and can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional. The mesh must be fine enough to accurately represent the problem, but not so fine that the analysis becomes computationally expensive.\n\nThe second step involves creating the finite element model, which is a mathematical representation of the problem. This involves specifying the type of element, element size, and element shape. Each element has properties that describe its behavior, such as stiffness, mass, and damping. These properties are used to calculate the stress, strain or displacement within the element.\n\nIn the third step, the loads and boundary conditions are applied to the model. These are the forces or other external influences that act on the model. The boundary conditions determine how the loads are distributed across the model.\n\nThe fourth step involves solving for the stress, strain or displacement within the elements. This is done using different methods, depending on the type of element used. For example, for 2D elements, the stress can be calculated using the finite difference or finite element method. For 3D elements, the finite element method is used. The solution is then updated across the entire model, and the process is repeated until a converged solution is obtained.\n\nThe fifth step involves repeating steps 1-4 until a solution is obtained, or until the maximum number of iterations is reached. During each iteration, the model is updated and the solution is recalculated until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.\n\nFEM is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of engineering problems. It is widely used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, civil engineering, electronics, and many others. FEM has significantly increased our understanding of the behavior of complex systems, and has led to advancements in design, materials, and manufacturing processes."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " (f ([, (c, ([--[–(subject, [c, (inf, (m (c (inf of ([ [ ( ((of (inf [of ( of ( of of ( of of of ( of ([ and of (-in (–ink of - (j (of (-p [subject [line (–pro (p (-character (h ([se ([supp (cer (c ([for (inc ( (1 ( (co (–in ((H (cer ((, (or (inf, (appro (h, (ho, ((p, [inf, (inf (per, (and (inf,, (In [of of, (in of,, of the of, ([[(m [over, (main, (inn of, [(inn (in, [in, [In, (in, inf, (with, (for (inn, (inf ( ([,, ( of [ of of of (of of ( ( - of ( of [ of the, of (in of ([(inf of (in [d ([[con, [in of [con of [du, (in [-[sm, of [inf, (dis [lo of (in (l, [t (c, In (inf, [p (b [se (c (c ([sa (int of [f (ci ([f of (of (([of of [(In (([ (([[[[ [c ([[c ([(( [in ( ( (sc ([re (dis ([[inc, (c ( (((c (lo (and (st (f (sa (([sur ( (c ( ( (in [, (-­ ( ( ((ce, [(d ([(for (con ((of ( [j (the ((ink (( (\n◄ (-j [su (((of of ( ("}

{"id": "koala_95", "prompt": "ideas for building a waitlist for a new product or service", "answer": "Here are few ideas for building a waitlist for a new product or service:\n\n1. Create a Sign-Up Form - One of the simplest and most effective ways to start building a waitlist for a new product or service is by creating a sign-up form on your website or through social media platforms. This form should include the details of the product or service you are offering, as well as a button that allows users to sign up to be notified when it becomes available.\n\n2. Offer Incentives - Offering incentives, such as discounts or free gifts, to those who sign up for your waitlist can help to increase interest and engagement. These incentives can be offered on a first-come, first-serve basis, or you can implement a point system that rewards users with higher points for signing up sooner.\n\n3. Personalize Communication - Personalizing your communication with waitlist subscribers can help to increase engagement and interest. This can be done by sending periodic updates about the status of the product or service, offering sneak peeks or exclusive discounts, or even offering a chance to be one of the first to receive it when it becomes available.\n\n4. Offer Alternatives - Whenever possible, offer alternatives to being on the waitlist, such as being notified when the product or service becomes available, receiving exclusive discounts or updates, or being sent a notification when it is no longer available. This can help to reduce the chances of losing customers due to frustration caused by waiting or being placed on a long list without any updates.\n\n5. Be Transparent - Being transparent and upfront about the waitlist process can help to reduce frustration and increase trust with customers. This can include clearly outlining the process, how long it may take, and how often customers can expect updates. It can also help to clearly communicate why a waitlist is necessary, and reassure customers that their information will not be shared or used for any other purpose.\n\nOverall, using a combination of these strategies, along with a clear and transparent process, can help to build a successful waitlist for a new product or service."}
{"id": "koala_96", "prompt": "assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual", "answer": "Okay, let's try this. I'm sorry you're feeling so frustrated and overwhelmed, it must be hard. Here's what I would recommend:\n\nFirst, take a deep breath and try to relax. Take a moment to think about what's happening right now. Is it really a big deal? Is it something that you can solve on your own? Can you put it off for a while? It's important to keep in mind that reacting immediately to everything that frustrates or annoys you can lead to stress and burnout.\n\nNext, try to put things into perspective. Is this issue really worth getting upset or stressed over right now? Is there something you can do to change the situation, or is it something you just have to accept?\n\nIf you decide that you need to take some action, try to think of possible solutions before reacting. Is there anything you can do to change the situation or at least make it more manageable? Could you delegate the task to someone else or ask for help?\n\nIf you decide that the situation is beyond your control, try to let it go. Remind yourself that this is something you can't change, and there's no point in wasting energy being upset or stressed over it. Remember that the only thing you can control is your reaction, so take a deep breath and try to let it go.\n\nWhen you find yourself in a situation where you feel like reacting, try to pause for a moment and take a deep breath. This can help you to step back, think about your options, and choose the most effective response.\n\nTry to practice this pause ritual in different situations, and you'll start to notice the difference it makes. Remember, it's okay to feel frustrated or upset, but it's not okay to let those feelings control your behavior. By taking a moment to pause, think, and choose your response, you can remain in control and deal with the situation in a more effective way."}

The recommended pattern for creating games in Godot is to use the following steps:\n\n1. Create a new project: In Godot, projects are used to organize and manage the assets and code of a game. To create a new project, navigate to File → New → Project in the main menu and provide a name for the project.\n\n2. Add assets: Once the project is created, you can start adding assets to it. These assets can include sprites, animations, sound effects, music, and any other resources that are needed for the game. To add an asset, navigate to Assets → Import in the main menu and select the file you want to import.\n\n3. Prepare the scene: Once all the assets have been added to the project, you can start creating the game scene. A scene is where the game logic is implemented, and it contains all the objects that are present in the game. To create a new scene, navigate to File → New → Scene in the main menu.\n\n4. Add code: After creating the scene, you can start adding code to it. This code will control the behavior of the game objects, and it can be written in any programming language that Godot supports.\n\n5. Test and iterate: Once the code is written, it's time to test the game and iterate on it. This involves playing through the game, identifying issues, and making changes to the code and assets until the game is working as desired.\n\nThese steps can be repeated to create multiple scenes and levels for a more complex game. Additionally, it's recommended to use version control, such as GitHub, to keep track of changes made to the project."}

A healthy diet should include a variety of foods within these macronutrient groups to ensure you are getting all the essential nutrients you need.\n\nAnother important aspect of nutrition is portion control. This involves monitoring the amount and type of foods you eat, and learning to choose the right portion size. Aim to fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables, a quarter with lean proteins, and the remaining quarter with whole grains or starchy foods.\n\nLastly, it is important to drink enough water throughout the day to keep your body hydrated.

We have two industries, B2B SaaS and Ecommerce. Within SaaS, we are used by customer success teams. Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

Doesn't this infringe on government interfering with private corporations?<br>", "answer": "The US government does have a role to play in the building of a pipeline, as it is a decision with far-reaching implications. As a general rule, the government does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of private companies, but there are exceptions. One of these is when the government believes that the interests of the public are best served by regulating or intervening in the actions of a private company. In the case of building a pipeline, the government may take a number of steps to ensure that the interests of the public are adequately considered and protected, including:\n\n1. Reviewing and approving the environmental impact of the project: The government must ensure that the pipeline is being built in a responsible manner, and that potential risks to the environment or local communities are mitigated.\n\n2. Regulating the safety and operations of the pipeline: The government must ensure that the pipeline is operated safely and in accordance with regulations.\n\n3. Addressing land use issues: The government must ensure that the pipeline's construction and operation do not infringe on private property rights or use of land.\n\n4. Assessing the economic impact: The government must consider the potential economic impact of the pipeline on various communities and industries.\n\nIn summary, while it is generally the case that the government does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of private companies, in the case of building a pipeline, the government must consider the interests of the public and take the necessary steps to ensure that the project is developed in a responsible and transparent manner."}

failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

{"id": "koala_148", "prompt": "#2. To increase the energy efficiency of windows, additional glass pane is added. In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "The energy efficiency of windows depends on several factors, including the type of glass, the number of panes, and how well the window is installed and sealed. \n\nIn general, double pane windows are more energy efficient than single pane windows, due to the added insulation provided by the second pane of glass. However, triple pane windows are even more energy efficient, and are often used in areas with a cold climate or where there is a lot of air pollution.\n\nTo increase the energy efficiency of a single pane window, the most effective way is to add a layer of insulating film or glass on the inside of the window. This is called a secondary glazing, and can be easily installed by the homeowner. A secondary glazing can increase the energy efficiency of a single pane window by up to 55%, and can reduce heating and cooling costs by up to 50%.\n\nFor double pane windows, the most effective way to increase their energy efficiency is to add argon gas or krypton gas between the panes of glass. This is called Low-E (low emittance) glass, and reduces the transfer of heat and ultra-violet light through the window. This can increase the energy efficiency of double pane windows by up to 30%, and can reduce heating and cooling costs by up to 25%.\n\nIn summary, a single pane window can be made more energy efficient by adding a layer of insulating film or glass on the inside, while double pane windows can be made more energy efficient by adding Low-E glass or argon gas between the panes of glass."}
{"id": "koala_149", "prompt": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment?", "answer": "In his book, The Challenge of Violence: Thinking About Fanon, Zizek, and Badiou, Kahane expands on his ethics of violence by addressing the responsibility of the American Jewish establishment towards the Palestinian people. Drawing from the philosophies of Frantz Fanon and Slavoj Žižek, Kahane argues that the Jewish establishment has an obligation to take action against Israel’s oppression of the Palestinian people. Kahane argues that the Jewish establishment has a unique responsibility towards the Palestinian people, as their oppression is directly linked to the suffering of the Jewish people in the past. He explains that the establishment’s inaction in the face of Israel’s oppression of the Palestinians is a continuation of the Jewish community’s inaction during the Holocaust, when they failed to take action against the Nazi persecution of the Jewish people.\n\nKahane’s ethics of violence echoes that of Fanon and Žižek in that he argues that violence can be used as a means to bring about social change. He explains that violence is not an end in and of itself, but rather a tool by which to bring about a more just and equitable society. For Kahane, violence is justified when it is used to bring about change, as in the case of the Jewish establishment’s failure to act against Israel’s oppression of the Palestinians.\n\nIn his discussion of the Jewish establishment’s responsibility towards the Palestinian people, Kahane also echoes the views of Fanon and Žižek in his critique of liberalism and the ineffectiveness of non-violent means of protest. Kahane argues that non-violent protests have failed to bring about change in the treatment of the Palestinian people, and that the Jewish establishment should instead embrace a more radical approach. He views the establishment’s commitment to non-violence as a form of cowardice, as they have chosen to remain silent in the face of injustice rather than take action to bring about change.\n\nIn sum, Kahane’s ethics of violence echoes that of Fanon and Žižek in that he views violence as a means to bring about social change, critiques the ineffectiveness of non-violent protest, and argues that the Jewish establishment has a unique responsibility towards the Palestinian people."}

Lack of Access to Markets: Many smallholder farmers in Africa do not have access to markets, which makes it difficult for them to sell their produce and get a fair price.\n\n3. Lack of Infrastructure: Poor road, rail, and port infrastructure make it difficult for farmers to transport their produce to market, leading to higher costs and reduced profitability.\n\n4. Land Degradation and Deforestation: Inappropriate farming practices, coupled with increasing population and urbanization, are leading to a rise in soil erosion and deforestation, reducing the ability of the land to produce.\n\n5. Climate Change: Climate change is affecting farming practices, crop yields, and food security in Africa, as extreme weather conditions become more frequent and intense.\n\n6. Pests and Diseases: Pests and diseases are threatening agricultural production and food security, as farmers lack access to effective pest management and crop-disease control methods.\n\n7. Population Growth and Urbanization: Africa's rapid population growth and urbanization are putting a strain on the land and resources used for agriculture, leading to a decline in per capita agricultural output.\n\n8. Poverty and Inequality: Poverty and inequality are major constraints for agricultural development in Africa, as many smallholder farmers find it difficult to access resources and information to improve productivity.\n\n9. Political Instability and Conflict: Political instability and conflict are leading to reduced agricultural productivity, as farmers flee their lands and natural resources are destroyed or stolen.\n\n10. Lack of Skilled Labor: A lack of skilled labor, including farmers, agricultural extension workers, and technical experts, is hampering the adoption of new technologies and practices in African agriculture."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is a very real and pressing issue, with significant impacts on our planet and its inhabitants. It is caused by the increasing levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, primarily as a result of human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and large scale agriculture. These GHGs trap heat and warm the atmosphere, leading to an increase in the Earth’s average temperature and causing a wide range of consequences.\n\nOne of the most prominent effects of climate change is the rise in average global temperatures, which has led to more intense heatwaves, more frequent droughts, and more severe storms. These changes are already having a significant impact on ecosystems, disrupting natural cycles and causing widespread damage. \n\nAnother major consequence of climate change is sea level rise, which is expected to accelerate as the Earth’s glaciers and ice sheets melt. This poses a significant threat to low-lying coastal areas, where millions of people live and a large number of cities and industries are located.\n\n\nClimate change is also expected to have a significant impact on the global food supply, as crop yields are already being affected by increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. This could lead to increased food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly in developing countries.\n\n\nFinally, climate change is likely to have a profound impact on public health, as it increases the transmission of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, and brings new ones like the Zika virus. These changes are also expected to have a disproportionate impact on the world’s poorest populations.\n\n\nIn short, climate change is a very real and serious threat, and its impacts are already being felt. To minimize the damage, it is essential to take immediate and decisive action to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to a low carbon economy. This involves a combination of both individual and collective efforts, such as increasing efficiency in energy use, driving less, switching to renewable energy sources, and supporting policies that promote sustainable development."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "It's all about the narrative structure. While a film has a beginning, middle, and end, a TV episode may have several plotlines that are developed over the course of the episode. This can make it easier to stay engaged with the story, as each plotline is likely to have a clear arc and resolution, which can add up to a satisfying experience. Additionally, TV shows often have recurring characters, which can help the audience to develop an emotional connection to the story and become more invested in the outcome. The longer length of a TV episode can also allow for more detailed character development, setting, and plot development, which can make for a more immersive experience."}
{"id": "koala_162", "prompt": "Findings from Jumping Monkey Hill (Story #1)\nPlease respond to the following questions/prompts below. Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.\n\nWhat were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "1. Disillusionment: The story begins with the narrator's expectations of the American Dream contrasted with the reality they experience upon arriving in the United States. This is further evidenced by the narrator's aunt and uncles' advice to avoid buying a gun, as it is not a common practice in America.\n\n2. Immigration: This motif is present in many ways, including the narrator's journey from Nigeria to the United States, their struggles adjusting to life in a new country, and the ways in which their immigration status impacts their daily lives.\n\n3. Family: This motif is present in several ways, including the narrator's relationship with their family members, their family's influence on their decisions and actions, and the ways in which their family members' experiences reflect a larger, universal journey of immigration and disillusionment with the American Dream."}

{"id": "koala_168", "prompt": "write a chronology of important events related to ESG in 2022", "answer": "2022 was a pivotal year for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments. Here is a chronology of important events in the world of ESG investing in 2022:\n\n1. January: The World Economic Forum publishes its Global Risks Report for 2022, highlighting the top ten risks to the global economy and society, including environmental catastrophes, cyberattacks, and geopolitical tensions. This report emphasizes the need for more action to mitigate these risks, and the importance of incorporating ESG considerations into investment decisions.\n\n2. February: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) exceeds the threshold of 30,000 points for the first time in history, driven by strong corporate earnings and investor optimism about the global economy. However, investors remain concerned about the potential impact of the viral outbreak on global economic growth, and the DJIA experiences a significant correction.\n\n3. March: The World Health Organization (WHO) declares the coronavirus pandemic to be a global emergency, and recommends a lockdown to contain the spread of infection. This leads to a significant drop in global economic activity and a surge in demand for ESG investments, as companies and governments look for ways to reduce their risk exposure and become more resilient.\n\n4. April: The European Union publishes the EU Action Plan on Sustainable Finance, which sets out a comprehensive framework for promoting sustainable finance within the EU. This plan includes a range of measures to increase transparency and accountability in the financial industry, and to incentivize investment in environmentally and socially responsible projects.\n\n5. May: The US Federal Reserve announces plans to buy $600 billion of Treasury securities over the next six months, in an attempt to boost the economy and mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This move is seen as a green light for investors to allocate more capital to ESG-focused investments, as the central bank looks to promote economic growth while also safeguarding the environment.\n\n6. June: The UN Global Compact launches the Compact for Responsible Banking, a set of principles for financial institutions to adopt in order to support sustainable development and promote responsible finance. This initiative is supported by over 130 banks and financial institutions, and is seen as a landmark step towards integrating ESG considerations into the banking sector.\n\n7. July: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announces that it will develop a new model for measuring and reporting the environmental sustainability of countries, as part of an effort to incorporate ESG factors into its global economic outlook. This move is seen as an acknowledgment of the growing importance of ESG considerations in financial decision-making, and is expected to encourage more investment in sustainable projects.\n\n8. September: The United Nations launches the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Finance Platform, a new initiative to accelerate the flow of private capital towards sustainable development projects. The platform offers a range of tools and data to help investors identify opportunities in the SDGs space, and is expected to greatly increase the momentum for ESG investment.\n\n9. October: The European Commission publishes its long-awaited action plan on sustainable finance, laying out a range of measures to drive green and social investment in the region. This plan includes a series of proposals for improving transparency and disclosure in the financial industry, as well as new policies to incentivize sustainable investment and risk management practices.\n\n10. November: The World Bank approves a $200 billion Green Bond Program, making it the first international financial institution to issue bonds exclusively for climate-related projects. This move is seen as a significant step towards mainstreaming ESG considerations in the financial sector, as it opens the door for increased investment in environmentally sustainable initiatives.\n\nThese events demonstrate that ESG investing is becoming increasingly mainstream, and is likely to remain a key trend in 2023 and beyond."}
{"id": "koala_169", "prompt": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence?", "answer": "No, it is not rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence. Believing in something without proof or evidence is what is known as irrational or unreasonable thinking. This type of belief is often referred to as a \"belief\" or \"faith,\" but it is not considered a rational or logical position. In fact, believing in things without evidence or proof can often lead to false conclusions, poor decision making, and even harmful actions. Rational people base their beliefs and actions on evidence and reason, rather than blind faith or emotion."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " of ( of ([f [w (n [c ((c ( [• ( ( ( [ ( [ (-B ( ( [-(c (–c-c [- [ of ( of of, of of of of of ( of of of of of, ( ((c of of of of of [­ of [[h of [c of [c [ ( ( [  ( [( ( ((c ((( (  ( [ [c [(t of a of [c [h [c [(c (n (m (ar [c or (c (c c of  ( of (h of ( [c ( and ( – ((com,c (-s (c of [b of ( of [ of [m of ( [ of ( ( [  of ( (c ( [ ( or ( [c of [( of ( of [al ( ([ ( ( [t ( [al (  [( and [dis and( of of and of [t of of ((h and of of ( – of of [-t of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of [of ( - and of (( – (  of or of of of of of of of of [ (: of [— –, [per of (, and of [l of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of ( of or of of of of of of of ( of of st of ( of (  of of of of ch of of of of of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of ( of of of ( of of the of of of of of and of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of ( [ of of of of ( of of of ( of of of of of of, of of of of that of ( [ of of ( of of of of of of [ of of ( of of of of of: of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of L of of of of of of of of of of (e of ( of ( h of ( [ of [ [ B [ [b [[ [ [ [ [ [www of [m ( [ [ [  [-he of of of of d of or of of of of of l, and and and and ( - ( of, of, –h [ of of e of of of of of, C ( and ( ( ( ( ( - [ [� [ ( of ( of [ ( ( [ ( ( [am back [ [ [ [ (( ( ( [ [ [; ( [ h- ( (  [( (-f ( and (m (( ( [ ([?
