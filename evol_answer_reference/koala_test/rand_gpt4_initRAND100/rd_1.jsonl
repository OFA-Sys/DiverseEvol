{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "The reason why banks cannot use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses is that cash is a liability for the bank in the books of accounting and thus cannot be used as capital. Capital is an asset on the books of accounting and cash is a liability. Cash is the actual money in the bank that can be withdrawn by the customers of the bank.\n\nIn order to understand this better, let's compare cash to equity. Equity is an asset on the books of accounting and cash is a liability. Equity indicates the amount of investment or money that the shareholders have invested in the bank and thus represents the bank's net worth. Cash, on the other hand, represents the amount of money that the bank has in its possession. It is the actual money that can be withdrawn by the customers of the bank."}

One day, he was sitting on his couch, and a young boy came up to him and asked, \"Can you tell me a story about nuclear physics like Dr. Seuss?\"\n\nDr. Seuss thought for a moment, then replied, \"I'd be happy to tell you a story about nuclear physics, but first I'll need to ask you a few questions.\"\n\nThe young boy nodded, and the physicist began. \"What do you know about nuclear physics?\"\n\nThe boy responded, \"Well, I know that nuclear physics is the study of the interactions between the nucleus and its constituents, such as protons and neutrons.\"\n\n\"That's a great start,\" said the physicist. \"So what else do you know about nuclear physics?\"\n\n\"I know that there are two main types of nuclear reactions: fission and fusion.\"\n\n\"Very good. And what do these reactions involve?\"\n\n\"Fission involves splitting apart a heavy atom, releasing energy in the process. Fusion, on the other hand, involves joining together light atoms like hydrogen, to form a heavier element, such as helium.\"\n\n\"Wow, that's some impressive knowledge you have there. So what else do you know about nuclear physics?\"\n\n\"Well, I also know that nuclear physics is very important, as it's used to generate nuclear power, as well as to develop nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said the physicist. \"So, I think you're definitely ready to hear my story about nuclear physics.\"\n\n\"Great!\" replied the young boy. \"Are you ready to begin?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the physicist. \"Once upon a time, there was a boy named Nucleus, who lived deep inside the nucleus of an atom. He had a lot of friends, and was a very happy boy.\n\nOne day, Nucleus' friends started telling him about the world outside the nucleus. They told him about the electrons that orbited around the nucleus, and how they moved in a precise manner, obeying the laws of quantum physics.\n\nNucleus was fascinated by their stories, and he couldn't wait to explore the outside world. So, one day, he decided to leave the safety of his home. As he passed through the nucleus, he met up with some other atoms, and they joined forces to become a molecule.\n\nTogether, they left the nucleus, and ventured out into the world. Once they were outside the nucleus, Nucleus and the rest of the molecule began to interact with other atoms and molecules, forming bonds and undergoing changes.\n\nAfter a while, the molecule broke apart, and Nucleus was left all alone. He was sad, as he had lost all his friends in the process. So, he decided to head back to the safety of the nucleus. As he was about to return home, he noticed an entire solar system, made up of planets, moons, and stars.\n\nNucleus was mesmerized by the beauty of the solar system, and decided to explore it further. He traveled through the solar system, and finally reached the sun. As he passed through the sun, he realized that it was much hotter and brighter than the stars surrounding it.\n\nNucleus then continued his journey, passing through the planets and moons of the solar system. As he was about to leave the solar system, he noticed another star, much brighter than the sun. He traveled through space, and passed by the star, which was much closer than the sun.\n\nNucleus was amazed by the star's brightness, and he knew he had to find out more about it. So, he continued his journey through space, and finally reached the star. As he passed through the star, he noticed that it was much hotter and brighter than the sun.\n\nNucleus was overcome with awe, as he witnessed the power of the star's intense gravitational pull. Then, he continued his journey, passing through the star's core, where the intense pressure and temperature caused all the atoms to fuse together to form new elements.\n\nNucleus was amazed by the star's energy and power, and he knew he had to find out more about it.

Firstly, could you introduce yourself and tell us a little about your background?\n\nFemale Film Director:Hi, my name is ‘Sonya’. I’m a female film director from the United States. I started making films when I was 13 years old. I was always interested in cinema and storytelling, and filmmaking allowed me to explore these interests and express myself creatively. I studied filmmaking at university and began directing short films, before working my way up to making feature-length films. I’ve worked on a wide range of projects in different genres, including drama, romance, horror, and comedy.\n\nJournalist:That’s incredible! It must have been a dream come true. What inspired you to become a film director?\n\nFemale Film Director:Everything! I’ve always been a creative person, and I’ve always been drawn to film. It’s a medium that’s so powerful and can be used to tell any kind of story. I was also inspired by the work of other female filmmakers, such as Sofia Coppola, Kathryn Bigelow, and Greta Gerwig. Their films showed me that it’s possible to be successful as a female film director, and that there are many opportunities for women in the industry.\n\nJournalist:That’s great to hear. So, what advice would you give to women who are interested in becoming film directors?\n\nFemale Film Director:Firstly, never be discouraged by the lack of female representation in the film industry. It’s important to remember that you don’t have to make films that are traditional or conform to the standard narrative. You can make films that are unique and tell stories that haven’t been told before. Secondly, embrace the fact that you’re a woman and use it to your advantage. Being a female film director can give you a unique perspective and allow you to tell female-centric stories. Finally, never stop learning and don’t be afraid to take risks. It’s important to always be open to new experiences and grow as a filmmaker.\n\nJournalist:That’s really great advice. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. One last question, if you had to pick one film that had the biggest impact on you, which film would it be?\n\nFemale Film Director:That’s a tough question! I have a lot of favourite films. One of my all-time favourites is The Virgin Suicides by Sofia Coppola. It’s a haunting and atmospheric film, and I love the way it unfolds and explores the emotions and relationships of its characters. It’s a beautiful film that portrays female empowerment, and it’s a reminder that women have the power to tell their own stories."}

There is nothing inherent in the molecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that makes them calorically dense. All molecules come in different sizes, shapes, and structures, and the energy required to break them down to their constituent atoms varies.\n\n2. The reason that carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are deemed to have caloric value is that our bodies use them as sources of energy. The energy released when these molecules are broken down by the enzymes in our digestive system can be measured and converted into a common unit of energy, the kilocalorie (kCal).\n\n3. The reason that 100g of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats have the same number of kCal, is that they each contain the same number of molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and these molecules have the same mass (i.e. 1 mole of carbon-12 atoms has a mass of 12g).

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "1. Define the instance segmentation AP metrics you wish to improve:\n\nThe metrics I would like to improve are:\n\na. Instance segmentation AP: The instance segmentation AP indicates the proportion of correctly detected instances out of the total number of instances detected.\n\nb. Instance segmentation F1 score: The instance segmentation F1 score indicates the harmonic mean between the precision and recall metrics, and is often used as a complementary measure to AP. It is calculated as: F1 score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall), where precision is the proportion of correctly detected instances among all instances considered to be instances, and recall is the proportion of correctly detected instances among all actual instances.\n\nc. Instance segmentation precision: The instance segmentation precision indicates the proportion of correctly detected instances out of the total number of instances detected as instances, and is often used as a complementary metric to AP.\n\nd. Instance segmentation recall: The instance segmentation recall indicates the proportion of correctly detected instances out of the total number of actual instances, and is often used as a complementary metric to AP.\n\n2. Explore the root causes of low AP and F1 scores: AP and F1 scores can be affected by a wide range of factors, including:\n\n- Insufficient training data: Low AP and F1 scores can often be a symptom of insufficient training data, which can result in overfitting and poor generalization of the model. In such cases, increasing the size of the training dataset can often improve the AP and F1 scores.\n\n- Incorrect instance segmentation prediction: Low AP and F1 scores can also be a symptom of incorrect instance segmentation predictions, which can often be caused by mislabeling of pixels or by the presence of false positives or false negatives. In such cases, a thorough analysis of the model's predictions can help to identify and correct any issues in the training or testing data.\n\n- Over-segmentation: In some cases, low AP and F1 scores can be caused by over-segmentation of the instances, which can result in the detection of too many or too few instances. In such cases, it may be worthwhile to fine-tune the segmentation threshold used by the model.\n\n- Insufficient data resolution: Low AP and F1 scores can also be caused by insufficient data resolution, which can result in the detection of coarser instances or poor localization of the instances. In such cases, it may be worthwhile to increase the resolution of the input data before training the model.\n\n3. Identify and address the root causes of low AP and F1 scores: Once the root causes of low AP and F1 scores have been identified, appropriate steps can be taken to address them. This could include:\n\n- Increasing the size of the training dataset: Increasing the size of the training dataset can often improve the AP and F1 scores, by reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the generalization of the model.\n\n- Reviewing the instance segmentation predictions: A thorough analysis of the model's predictions can help to identify and correct any issues in the training or testing data, and can often improve the AP and F1 scores.\n\n- Fine-tuning the segmentation threshold: In some cases, a fine-tuning of the segmentation threshold used by the model can improve the AP and F1 scores, by reducing the number of false positives or false negatives.\n\n- Increasing the data resolution: Increasing the data resolution can often improve the AP and F1 scores, by reducing the risk of coarse segmentation or poor localization of the instances.\n\n4. Re-train the model with improved data: In some cases, re-training the model with improved data can improve the AP and F1 scores, by providing the model with more accurate training data. This could include:\n\n- Adding new training data: In some cases, adding new training data can improve the AP and F1 scores, by providing the model with more accurate data. This could include:\n\n- Adding new images: Adding new images to the training data can improve the AP and F1 scores, by providing the model with more examples of the instances to be detected. This could include:\n\n- Adding images from different regions or lighting conditions: Adding images from different regions or lighting conditions can improve the AP and F1 scores, by providing the model with more examples of the instances to be detected under a variety of conditions.\n\n- Adding images with different instance sizes or densities: Adding images with different instance sizes or densities can improve the AP and F1 scores, by providing the model with more examples of the instances to be detected under different conditions.\n\n- Adding"}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " in. and in. and in in and and and in (t al in in in [t (t in and in in over in, in (t and in in (part tum by ab of. and in in a in in re to to or to to to to to to c to (un and [h of and of of [part of and n,-f in (st and [in and and in. and, (b of of (2 of ((th st and and, ch, and. b, in and vis as in and (and and and h [h (c (in (in s, and in, in,, (st.c. d,(h,,, (k [(dis,., in in h pr in to s in sut to (sh [as as as [[my [and [d [c [p [c t in [and, in (c in and t in in h-b s-mys in (c in in and in and,th [in in in [[f and of [my-[d in of [c of, [c, of of of of of my s and and and more (c and of (in of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of and of non, or in in in in s, of of of of of of of of of in of of of of of of of of, and in and and d and and and in as as as and un as of as as as as of (h and of, and as as, c of of of of of of as of of of of of as of of of of A(p as as in and to in as as A, and of and of of of of of of of of of of A,, A (c and and. and at. and of of of of of of of of and of of in of and e in in in [d of and and and at. and (b st[s of in of of the of of more of of (of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [C of of of and of and and (f and and and and and and and and and and of and of of of of of of our in (b and in in h and and and and in and, and, ,A (A Re. of of of of of and of a of of of of of ,p of of, of .th of [b of of -of[of of as of of of of of my of [A [and of or of of of of and, and as in in, in in of and of b. sing of in in of and of of of of of of in of of of of of, of of in and in (t. and and (N and ,t.

{"id": "koala_43", "prompt": "6Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 2000 words article include a headings about  Based on our investigation so far, Reddit user passwords and accounts are safe, but on Sunday night (pacific time), Reddit systems were hacked as a result of a sophisticated and highly-targeted phishing attack. They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "Here ​ \n\nAns 20-10-11. This month. Afterline 1123 day 1."}

They are 90% in the first quarter, 92% in the second quarter, 81% in the third quarter and 88% in the fourth quarter. What is the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters?", "answer": "To find the total profit percent over a period of time, based upon these quarters, we need to find the total profits made in each quarter, and then add them up.\n\nFor the first quarter, the total profits were $81, and so the total profit percent for the first quarter was 90% ($81 / $90).\n\nFor the second quarter, the total profits were $92, and so the total profit percent for the second quarter was 92% ($92 / $100).\n\nFor the third quarter, the total profits were $76, and so the total profit percent for the third quarter was 81% ($76 / $93).\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the total profits were $97, and so the total profit percent for the fourth quarter was 88% ($97 / $113).\n\nAdding up all the profit percentages for the quarters, we get a total profit percent of 88.5% (88% + 81% + 92% + 88%).\n\nThis means that in total, 88.5% of the profits were made in the four quarters."}

He was a loyal friend and ally, and a true hero of the galaxy.\n\nLord Vos had traveled the galaxy for several years, and he had visited many planets and civilizations. He had seen much violence and suffering, but he always strove to do what was right and to bring peace and justice to the galaxy.\n\nLord Vos had also witnessed the rise and fall of the Republic, and the rise of the Empire. He had fought in many battles, and he had lost many friends and comrades. He was now an old man, and he had little desire to engage in more conflict.\n\nHowever, he was still willing to aid those in need, and to defend the galaxy against darkness and tyranny. He had vowed to uphold the Jedi Code and to defend the innocent, and he was prepared to give his life for the cause.\n\nThe Jedi Order was suffering under the oppressive rule of the Sith, and many Jedi Knights had been forced to flee and go into hiding. Lord Vos had no family or loved ones, and he had chosen to remain in the galaxy to fight for the greater good.\n\nAnakin Skywalker was a young Jedi Padawan, and he had been assigned to work with Lord Vos as his mentor.

{"id": "koala_73", "prompt": "How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from?", "answer": "To understand how money goes from your pocket to supporting a business, we need to take a step back and look at the stock market as a whole. The stock market is a place where companies can raise money by selling shares of their company to investors. These investors then own a small piece of the company. When the company does well, the stock price goes up and these investors can make money when they sell their shares. When the company does poorly, the stock price goes down and investors can lose money when they sell their shares. The stock market provides a platform for investors and companies to come together to support businesses.\n\nMoney goes from your pocket to supporting a business through the stock market in a few different ways. First, when you buy shares of a company, you're effectively giving them money. This money goes towards funding the company, which could be used to expand operations, develop new products, or invest in research and development. Second, when companies issue shares to investors, this money is then available to be used by the company. This could mean hiring more employees, investing in new equipment, or spending money on marketing and advertising. Third, when investors sell their shares on the stock market, the money they receive is put back into circulation. This could mean that the investor is putting the money back into their pocket, or using it to invest in another company or fund. Ultimately, the money that goes from your pocket to supporting a business through the stock market is used to fund growth and expansion for the company.\n\nHope this helps, and happy investing!"}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth.

Mishkin and published by McGraw-Hill Education in 2007. The book is a part of the \"Economics: Theory and Application\" series and is known to be an \"extensive and comprehensive\" overview of the topics covered in the first half of a standard undergraduate finance or money and banking course. It is often used as a textbook in universities worldwide.\n\nMishkin introduces the topic by discussing the importance of financial markets and institutions for efficient allocation of resources in a modern economy. He explains that the financial system facilitates the flow of funds from savers to investors and helps channel saving into productive investments. It also plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability of the financial system by mitigating the risk of financial shocks and managing the overall liquidity conditions in the economy.\n\nThe book covers a wide range of topics on financial markets and institutions, including the structure and functioning of financial markets, the role of financial intermediaries, money and monetary policy, banking regulation and supervision, financial crises and their resolution, and the role of financial institutions in the economy. Mishkin also explains the links between financial markets and institutions and other important topics in macroeconomics, such as fiscal and monetary policy, trade and exchange rates, and asset prices."}
{"id": "koala_86", "prompt": "when are hops added to the brewing process?", "answer": "In the brewing process, hops are typically added during the \"boil.\" This is usually the last step of the brewing process, where the wort (unfermented beer) is heated to kill any yeast and other microorganisms, and to extract the bitter flavors and aromas from the hops.\n\nHops can be added at several points during the boil, depending on the desired flavor and aroma profile. For aromatic hop additions, the hops are typically added at the beginning of the boil to maximize the volatile oils that are released during the boil. For bittering hop additions, the hops are typically added later in the boil to maximize the alpha acids that are responsible for the bitterness in the beer.\n\nDepending on the type of beer being made, hops can also be added after the boil, either as a dry hop addition or as a post-fermentation hop addition. In a dry hop addition, the hops are added after the boil, but before the beer is package. In a post-fermentation hop addition, the hops are added after fermentation and before the beer is package. These hop additions help develop the aroma and flavor of the beer, particularly the floral and hop aromas, without adding significant bitterness."}
{"id": "koala_87", "prompt": "Can a Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 hypothetically lift Mount everest", "answer": "In theory, the Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 could hypothetically lift Mount Everest. The crane has a maximum lifting capacity of 1,100 tonnes and a maximum lifting radius of 107 metres. However, it would require a significant amount of counterweights, which would add considerable weight to the crane, reducing its capacity. It would also require an enormous amount of craneage, which would further reduce its capacity.\n\nIt is also worth considering the size of the crane. The Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 is a large crane, and would need to be transported to the location where the lift would take place. This would take time and effort, and would use up valuable resources.\n\nThe crane would also need to be properly set up, which would take a significant amount of time. This would further reduce its capacity, and could even make the lift impossible.\n\nIn summary, in theory, the Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 could hypothetically lift Mount Everest. However, it would require a significant amount of time, effort and resources, and would pose several logistical challenges."}

This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

The setting for the film can be Sylt, a picturesque island in the north of the country known for its white sandy beaches and beautiful scenery.\n\nThe story begins in the 19th century, when the island was home to a large fishing community. One night, the fishermen return to port with strange tales of a mysterious force that has been attacking their boats. The terrified men claim that it was not a natural phenomenon, but some evil spirit that is haunting the waters around the island.\n\nOver the following days, more of the island's inhabitants start to experience bizarre symptoms, such as paranoia, hallucinations, and violent outbursts. Some even begin to lose touch with reality, believing that their loved ones have been replaced by sinister creatures. Soon the entire island is in the grip of madness, and the authorities are left powerless to stop the carnage.\n\nIn the end, the island's inhabitants are driven to the brink of insanity, and many of them commit suicide or turn on one another in a frenzy of violence.

As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals.\n\nMy experience as an African American has given me a unique perspective on the world. I have learned to value the rich cultural heritage and traditions of my community. However, traveling and living abroad has also taught me about the diverse experiences of other black people around the world. For example, I recently visited Ghana, where I had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the country's history and culture. I learned about the important role of the Golden Stool in Ashanti culture and the significance of the Adinkra symbols in Ghanaian traditions.\n\nSimilarly, I have also experienced the culture of my African ancestors. During my childhood, my family often celebrated Kwanzaa, an African-American holiday that celebrates our heritage and culture. I remember learning about the seven principles of Kwanzaa, which include unity, responsibility, cooperative, purpose, creativity, and faith. These principles helped me to appreciate the rich history and traditions of my community.\n\nIn summary, my experiences as an African American and African have enriched my understanding of the various cultures of black people around the world. I have learned that no matter where we come from, we are all connected by our shared experiences and culture.

{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are used in buildings as reinforcement materials, structural materials, and as insulating materials. Their use is expected to grow in the coming years, as the demand for energy-efficient and durable buildings increases.\n\n1. As reinforcement materials: Carbon fibers are used in composite materials, such as fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs), to reinforce structures and improve their strength and durability. FRPs are used in building structures, including beams, columns, and walls, as well as in architectural components, such as facades and roofs. Carbon fibers are also used in concrete to increase its tensile and flexural strength.\n\n2. As structural materials: Carbon fibers are often used as structural materials in buildings, such as in the form of carbon fibers reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites or carbon fiber reinforced concrete (CFRC) composites. These composites are used in structural components such as beams, columns, and slabs, offering high strength and stiffness at low weight. This makes them an ideal choice for buildings that need to be lightweight, such as tall skyscrapers or green buildings.\n\n3. As insulating materials: Carbon fibers are often used as insulating materials in buildings, such as in insulation panels, insulation boards, and insulation blocks. These materials are made by embedding layers of carbon fibers in a polymer matrix. They have high thermal insulation and soundproofing properties, making them an ideal choice for insulating walls, ceilings, and floors.\n\n4. In other applications: Carbon fibers are also used in several other applications in buildings, such as as construction and repair materials, fire protection materials, and acoustic panels.\n\nOverall, carbon fibers have several advantages over traditional reinforcement materials, such as steel and concrete, making them an ideal choice for use in buildings."}
{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "1. Inadequate investment in agriculture: Agriculture is a key sector in Africa, yet agricultural investment remains low, with less than half of the continent's gross domestic product (GDP) spent on agriculture. Despite the sector's importance, there is a lack of investment in technology, agricultural research and infrastructure.\n\n2. Lack of access to land and resources: A significant proportion of Africa's population depends on agriculture, yet they have little access to land and resources. This includes poor, female-headed households and smallholder farmers, who often lack the resources to improve their productivity and income.\n\n3. Lack of education and skills: Many farmers lack the education and skills to improve their productivity and income, leading to low crop yields and low incomes. This includes young people, who are often drawn toward other employment opportunities.\n\n4. Poor market infrastructure: Africa's agriculture markets are often fragmented, with inadequate storage, transportation and processing facilities. This hinders the movement of agricultural products to markets and reduces their value.\n\n5. Inadequate access to financing: Agricultural financing remains low, with less than one percent of Africa's GDP spent on credit to smallholder farmers. This makes it difficult for farmers to obtain the financing they need to invest in technology, agricultural research and infrastructure.\n\n6. Natural resource degradation: The degradation of Africa's natural resources, including soil, water and forests, limits agricultural production and hinders the transition to more sustainable farming practices.\n\n7. Climate change: Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, reducing agricultural productivity and food security.\n\n8. Pests and diseases: Pests and diseases are limiting crop productivity and food security, with the current El Niño-induced drought in southern Africa threatening to worsen food shortages.\n\n9. Growing population: Africa's population is increasing rapidly, with the continent's population expected to more than double by 2050. This places additional pressure on agricultural resources, and the challenge of meeting the growing demand for food.\n\n10. Conflict and insecurity: Conflict and insecurity in Africa are limiting agricultural production and food security, particularly in countries affected by civil war or violent extremism."}

This approach makes it easier for viewers to consume the content in small, manageable chunks, which in turn, helps to reduce the amount of mental and emotional effort required to comprehend and process it.\n\nIn contrast, films are usually longer and more complex, often requiring a significant commitment of time and attention in order to understand and appreciate them. This additional effort is what makes it feel like more work to watch a film, compared to a TV series."}

Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "Three motifs that were found to be present in this story are: American Dream/Disillusionment, Globalization, and Immigration.\n\n1. American Dream/Disillusionment: This motif can be seen in the following passage: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). This passage highlights the disillusionment that the main character experiences after arriving in America, realizing that not everyone there has a big car and a gun, and that it's not easy to achieve the American Dream.\n\n2. Globalization: This motif is present in the following passage: \"You thought you were the first person to ever think of going to America. You were wrong. It turns out everybody in the world wants to go to America, and it is the only country where everybody wants to go\" (Adichie 115). This passage highlights the globalization of the American dream, showing that it's not just the United States that dreams about achieving success, but also people from all over the world.\n\n3. Immigration: This motif is present in the following passage: \"Your uncles and aunts and cousins thought you were going to be the first Nigerian to move to America and buy a car, and a house, and a gun. They had never seen American movies, but they thought the American Dream could be achieved in one month, or six, or two years. They told you to be patient, that in America, things take time\" (Adichie 115). This passage highlights the immigration motif, showing how the main character's family and friends thought that she would be the first person to achieve the American Dream in Nigeria, but it turns out that she is just one of many who are trying to do so."}

These granulomas can form in almost any part of the body, but they usually show up in the lungs, lymph nodes, or eyes.\n\nThe causes of sarcoidosis are unknown, but it's thought to be an immune system disorder. In people with sarcoidosis, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. This leads to inflammation and the formation of granulomas.\n\nThe symptoms of sarcoidosis can vary widely. Some people with the disease don't have any symptoms at all, while others may experience:\n\n* Shortness of breath or a chronic cough\n* Weight loss and fatigue\n* Swollen or painful lymph nodes\n* Eye problems, such as redness, blurry vision, or vision loss\n* Skin rashes or lesions\n* Joint pain or swelling\n\nSarcoidosis can also affect the heart, liver, spleen, and digestive system. Some people develop life-threatening complications, such as heart failure or liver damage.\n\nThere is no cure for sarcoidosis, but treatment can help manage the symptoms. The treatment plan usually involves a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, surgery.\n\nSarcoidosis can often go into remission on its own, but even with treatment, it can come back at any time."}

{"id": "koala_169", "prompt": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence?", "answer": "No, it is not rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence.\n\nBeliefs are just one type of thought, and they require some evidence to support them. In particular, for a belief to be rational, it must be supported by objective evidence. That is, it must be based on facts that can be verified by anyone, regardless of their personal beliefs or opinions.\n\nSo, for example, it would not be rational to believe that Santa Claus is real, given that there is no objective evidence for this. Similarly, it would not be rational to believe in the supernatural, such as a God or ghosts, given that there is no objective evidence for these entities.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be rational to believe in things for which there is objective evidence. For example, it would be rational to believe that the Earth is round, given that there is objective evidence for this, such as the shadow of the Earth during a lunar eclipse.\n\nTo summarize, it is not rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence, as this would require you to ignore the facts and base your beliefs on nothing but personal feelings or opinions."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " ((as [-qu (ve ([(qu ((C ((N ([: (n (f (( [c ( or ([ – (: – ( - – ( ( of the ( of (of of of the of the, (e of [both of of(of of of or of of the (C (c [(((c [w or of ((of (am [–(p (c and – and (c (c (c (t-s [c, [[’ ((N [c, (c -c (s it ((s it s ( (p of ([ of (f of, ( - (be ((A, ((? –  [m ( ( of the of a of (w of ( (h [(t ( (c (k (c (com of ((l of ( - (C of those of -c of you, (p in (st – and and in and of n of and of ((of of or of, and and of (-w of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of: of – of of a of of of (m of of of of of of of (t of ( of (h and,, in in [c of (: of (and of of of of of of of of of, of of of ( of of of of and of of of of ( of of or of of of of ( of, ( of ch of and of of a of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the of of of of of of of of of of of of the of of of of of of of of and of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of that of m that of (( of of of of of of of of of of st of of of of of of ( of of of ((of of of of of of ( of of of of of ( of of of of of of - of of of of of of, of (: C ( ( [( [ch [b ( [-be [ne of our [ou [ [ [, ( of ( of of [of ( and of or of or of of – of,, and,, and and, as of, of (, of our-of-m of the-W and and, (ale, (, ( or ( ( of for of of ( [ ( of ( C [-e ( ( ( (, ( [ ( ( ( ( (, (h ( ( ( H ( for ( ( [( – ( ( - ( and ( ( ( – F and in ( R [, ( ( C ( – of [ ( that ( ( of ( ( ( and (, and ( in, ( ( ( – ( ( ( (ne (h – of, of of [ ( ( (c ( ( ( [ ( ( (, [( [ ( ( ( ( ( ( (.

{"id": "koala_179", "prompt": "How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table?", "answer": "There are several ways to calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table. One method is to count the number of unique combinations of 3 characters and 4 characters, which is given by 3!4! = 24. The other method is to use a mathematical formula, which is given by V = n! / (n - r)!, where V is the number of variations, n is the total number of possible characters, r is the number of repeated characters, and ! is the factorial operator. In this case, V = 3!4! / (3 - 0)!, or 24 / 2, which gives us the answer of 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 12."}
