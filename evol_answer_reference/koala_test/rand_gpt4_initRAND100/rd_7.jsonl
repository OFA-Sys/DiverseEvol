{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banks use a variety of sources to raise capital, including cash, deposits, and debt, to cover potential losses and meet their obligations. Cash is an important source of capital for banks as it can be easily converted into cash to meet liquidity requirements and settle debts. However, cash or any other liquid asset can only be used as a buffer for potential losses up to a certain point.\n\nOnce a bank's capital falls below a certain level, it becomes insolvent and is unable to meet its obligations. This is where the use of debt and equity become crucial to maintaining a sufficient capital buffer. Bank debt provides a stable source of funding as it comes with fixed interest payments that can be used to cover interest expenses and other obligations. Equity capital, on the other hand, is more volatile as it is subject to market fluctuations and can be wiped out completely in the event of a bank failure. However, equity capital also allows for greater growth opportunities as it provides the bank with a larger funding base.\n\nIn summary, cash is an important source of capital for banks, but it can only be used as a buffer for potential losses up to a certain point. Beyond that point, debt and equity become essential to maintaining a sufficient capital buffer."}

It was a small, glowing ball, and it was pulsing with energy. Nuclein knew that he had to find out what it was, so he picked it up in his hands and took it back to his house.\n\nAs he sat at his kitchen table, examining the ball, he noticed that it was getting brighter and hotter. Suddenly, the ball exploded in a shower of sparks. Nuclein was startled by the blast, but he was also amazed by what had happened. He knew then that he had discovered something powerful and mysterious.\n\nFrom that day on, Nuclein dedicated himself to studying the strange object. He read every book he could find on nuclear physics, and he conducted experiments to learn more about the properties of the ball. As he delved deeper into the subject, he realized that the power of the ball was limitless. It could be used to create energy, to power the world, to provide light where there was darkness.\n\nAnd so, Nuclein set out on a quest to share his discovery with the world. He traveled from village to village, teaching others about nuclear physics and how to harness its power. His fame grew, and he became known as the Nuclear Prophet. People flocked to him for his wisdom and his knowledge, and together they worked to build a better future, powered by the energy of the atom.\n\nAnd so, the story of Nuclein and the strange glowing ball ended happily ever after, with the world united and its people living in peace and prosperity, all thanks to the power of nuclear physics."}

{"id": "koala_8", "prompt": "Can you write a short story where Hildibrand Manderville somehow gets transformed into Gandalf the Grey and he must work with The Warrior of Light and Nashu to restore his regular, most gentlemanly form. ", "answer": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a most distinguished wizard by the name of Hildibrand Manderville. He was renowned throughout the kingdom for his great wisdom and skill in magic, and was called upon to solve the most difficult problems with ease. However, there was one problem that had eluded him for many years, and no matter how hard he tried, he could not find the answer.\n\nThis problem concerned the nature of magic itself, and its relationship to the material world. Manderville had always believed that magic was merely an illusion, a trick of the mind that allowed one to perceive the world in ways that were not possible in reality. However, some people claimed to have witnessed magic in action, performing seemingly impossible feats that defied the laws of nature. Manderville had always dismissed these claims as nothing more than folklore or superstition, but the thought nagged at him nonetheless.\n\nOne day, while he was deep in thought about this matter, a strange young man appeared before him. He was tall and thin, with long, flowing hair and piercing blue eyes. He introduced himself as the Warrior of Light, and said that he had come to Manderville for help.\n\n\"I have been sent on a quest,\" he said, \"to retrieve an ancient artifact from the depths of the mountains. But before I can embark on my journey, I must first undergo a trial by fire.\"\n\nManderville was intrigued by the young man's story, and offered to help in any way he could. The Warrior of Light thanked him, and asked if he would accompany him on his quest.\n\nManderville was hesitant at first, but the Warrior of Light assured him that it would be perfectly safe. So, with some reluctance, he agreed to go with him.\n\nThe next morning, they set out together, following the young man's directions to the mountains. As they journeyed deeper into the wilderness, the weather turned colder and the path become more treacherous. They were forced to camp for the night, and as they huddled around the campfire to keep warm, the Warrior of Light pulled out an ancient looking staff and began to chant.\n\nSuddenly, there was a flash of light, and when it cleared, Manderville found himself standing in a completely different place. It was like he had been transported to another world, one where magic was as real as the air he breathed.\n\nThe Warrior of Light led him to a tall, ancient oak tree, and the two of them climbed up into the branches. There they found a small wooden chest, nestled among the leaves.\n\nThe Warrior of Light reached into his pocket and pulled out a key, which he used to unlock the chest. Inside was an old, golden staff, which the Warrior of Light took from the chest and placed in his hands.\n\n\"This is the staff of Gandalf the Grey,\" he said. \"It has been waiting here for you, and only you can wield its power.\"\n\nManderville was stunned. He had never even heard of Gandalf the Grey before, but the staff felt strangely familiar in his hands. He closed his eyes and concentrated, and when he opened them again, he was no longer the distinguished wizard Hildibrand Manderville, but rather, the powerful wizard Gandalf the Grey.\n\nThe Warrior of Light looked at him with a smile. \"Welcome to Middle-earth,\" he said. \"It is time for you to begin your quest.\"\n\nAnd so, Gandalf the Grey set out on his journey, accompanied by the Warrior of Light and Nashu the dwarf, as they searched for the ancient artifact and undertook many adventures in the process.\n\nAnd as they travelled from place to place, they met many interesting people and encountered many challenges, but in the end, they were successful in their quest.\n\nWhen they returned to the place where they had first met the Warrior of Light, they found that the staff of Gandalf the Grey had been returned to its rightful owner. And Manderville was once again, Hildibrand Manderville, the distinguished wizard he had always been.\n\nBut he no longer believed that magic was an illusion. In fact, he had come to realize that magic was very real, and that it was an essential part of the world. And he vowed to use his powers for the good of the kingdom, not just for his own benefit.\n\nAnd so, from that day on, Manderville devoted himself to the service of others,"}

It tells the story of Ivan Ilych, a seemingly well-respected attorney who dies unexpectedly, and the profound spiritual and emotional struggles he goes through in the days leading up to his death.\n\nThroughout the story, we see Ivan Ilych living what he believes to be the ideal life: he has a respectable job, a loving family, and is well-liked and admired by others. But as the story progresses, we learn that Ivan Ilych is not happy. He is plagued by a deep sense of meaninglessness, feeling like his life has no purpose or significance. He is obsessed with the thought that when he dies, he will be forgotten and his life will have been for nothing.\n\nAs Ivan Ilych nears death, he realizes that his entire life has been a lie, built on false pretense and meaningless achievements. He comes to the painful realization that his success and status meant nothing because he had not lived according to his true self and his true values.\n\nIn the end, Ivan Ilych dies with a profound sense of regret and longing for something more in his life. He comes to the realization that true happiness and meaning can only be found through love, selflessness, and service to others.\n\nOverall, The Death of Ivan Ilych is a powerful reminder that we should not define our worth or success by external measures, but instead by our internal values and the impact we make in the world. It is a warning against living a life of materialism and status, and a call to live authentically and pursue what truly matters."}

So, where do I get the fabric?\n\nSEAMSTRESS: You can purchase it from a fabric store or online. \n\nPRICKLES: Alright, I'll look for some fabric online. \n\nSEAMSTRESS: That's a good idea. Another option is to use a fabric from your own wardrobe if it's in good condition.\n\nPRICKLES: I don't have a lot of clothes, so I'm not sure if I have any fabric I could use.\n\nSEAMSTRESS: Don't worry, you can always buy new fabric. Just make sure it's the right type and quality for the project. \n\nPRICKLES: (Looks around) Where do I keep the fabric?\n\nSEAMSTRESS: You don't keep it, you purchase it. \n\nPRICKLES: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant like from my wardrobe. \n\nSEAMSTRESS: No, that's the fabric for the dress. You need to purchase new fabric for the project.\n\nPRICKLES: Oh, I see. \n\nSEAMSTRESS: So, have you decided what type of fabric you want for the dress?\n\nPRICKLES: Umm, I'm not sure. What types are there?\n\nSEAMSTRESS: There are many types of fabric, but the most common ones are cotton, wool, and polyester. \n\nPRICKLES: Oh, I see. So, which one should I use for the dress?\n\nSEAMSTRESS: That depends on what type of dress you want to make. Is it for everyday wear or for a special occasion? Do you want it to be casual or formal?\n\nPRICKLES: Um, I want it to be for a special occasion. I want it to be elegant and luxurious. \n\nSEAMSTRESS: In that case, you should use a high-quality fabric, like silk or satin. \n\nPRICKLES: Wow, that sounds amazing. \n\nSEAMSTRESS: Yes, it's a beautiful fabric, but it's also more expensive.\n\nPRICKLES: I'm not sure if I can afford it. Is there any other type of fabric that's equally elegant but more affordable?\n\nSEAMSTRESS: Yes, you"}

{"id": "koala_23", "prompt": "How well does the following response respond to the prompt? ..... Prompt=  \n\nAfter reading Lalor’s Chapter 8 as well as Goode’s explanation of curriculum evaluation necessity and models, explain what your school does to evaluate curriculum. Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.  Study.com.  Retrieved October 12, 2019. \n\n ", "answer": "Thornton Township District 205's curriculum evaluation method is similar to the Tabba Model, as described by Goode, in that it involves a team of teachers and administrators evaluating the effectiveness of the curriculum and resources. However, there are some differences. First, the team of teachers and administrators does not work together during the year, but rather, only during the summer, when they are required to attend summer institutes. This means that the team is not able to constantly monitor the use of resources and unit plans, and is only able to evaluate the curriculum once a year, which may not be frequent enough to truly determine its effectiveness.\n\nSecond, the curriculum evaluation in District 205 is not based on common assessment structures and data analysis, which is necessary for determining the effectiveness of the curriculum. Without a consistent set of assessments and data analysis, it would be difficult to determine whether or not the curriculum is meeting the desired outcomes. Thus, while the Tabba Model is a good framework for curriculum evaluation, District 205's approach may not be as effective."}

The city was concerned about the high rates of drowning among children and wanted to implement measures to reduce the risk of water-related accidents. After conducting an extensive research and analysis of the situation, I developed a detailed plan to improve water safety in the city.\n\nThe first step of the project was to identify high-risk areas. I conducted a risk assessment of the city's public pools, beaches, and water parks to identify areas with a high likelihood of drowning incidents. The assessment included an analysis of past accidents, water depth, swimming ability of users, and the presence of safety equipment. Based on the results of the assessment, I identified areas with the highest risk and developed measures to improve safety in those locations.\n\nThe next step was to educate the public about water safety. I worked with the city to develop an awareness campaign that focused on water safety tips, such as never swim alone, supervise children at all times, and ensure that all swimmers know how to swim. I also recommended the installation of lifesaving equipment, such as lifeguards, alarms, and emergency exits, to help prevent drownings in high-risk areas.\n\nThe final step of the project was to implement my recommendations. I worked with the city to develop a plan for increasing safety at high-risk areas. This included the installation of lifesaving equipment, additional staff at high-risk locations, and the enforcement of safety regulations. I also conducted follow-up assessments to ensure that the measures were effective in reducing the risk of drownings.\n\nIn summary, the water safety project was a large and complex undertaking, but with the implementation of my plan, the city of Boston was able to significantly improve water safety. The measures I recommended reduced the risk of drowning and helped to make the city's waterways safer for everyone."}

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "Instance segmentation is an important task in computer vision, as it involves identifying and delineating objects within an image. This task is usually measured using an AP metric, which stands for average precision. The AP metric represents the average precision of the proposed instances over all ground-truth instances in an image, and it is calculated as follows:\n\nAP = tp / (tp + fp + fn)\nwhere tp is the number of true positives, fp is the number of false positives, and fn is the number of false negatives.\n\nWhile the AP metric provides an abstract measure of the segmentation performance, it does not take into account the context and visual appearance of the objects. As a result, it may not fully reflect the human perception of the segmentation results, leading to suboptimal improvements with the aid of human knowledge.\n\nHere are some steps to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge:\n\n1. Visualize the ground-truth and predicted instances: Visualizing the ground-truth and predicted instances can provide valuable insights into the segmentation performance. This can be done by plotting the instances on an image, with the ground-truth instances marked as bounding boxes and the predicted instances as polygons.\n\n2. Analyze the instances: Analyzing the instances and their relationships can help improve segmentation performance. For example, if there are multiple instances of the same object within the image, it may be beneficial to group them together to increase the recall.\n\n3. Ensure the input data is labeled correctly: Double-checking the input data for labeling errors can improve segmentation performance. This can be done by visualizing the instances and comparing them to the ground-truth labels.\n\n4. Identify and remove background clutter: Removing background clutter from the image can improve segmentation performance. This can be done by thresholding the image, eroding the image to remove small background regions, or using a background segmentation model.\n\n5. Use object masks or bounding boxes: Using object masks or bounding boxes can improve segmentation performance, as they provide more information about the shape and location of the object. This can be done by creating object masks or bounding boxes using a segmentation mask or a bounding box detector.\n\n6. Use context or class information: If the instance segmentation model uses context or class information, using this information can improve segmentation performance. This can be done by providing class or context labels to the model during training or by using an instance-level classifier.\n\n7. Use instance-level or object-level classifiers: Using an instance-level or object-level classifier can improve segmentation performance. This can be done by training a separate classifier on the instance-level or object-level labels, or by using a pre-trained model for instance segmentation.\n\nIn summary, using human knowledge and insight can help improve instance segmentation AP metrics by visualizing the instances, analyzing the data, ensuring the input data is labeled correctly, removing background clutter, using object masks or bounding boxes, using context or class information, using instance-level or object-level classifiers, and further refining the segmentation model."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " [ct.

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related, as both involve holding contradictory beliefs or views. People who are ideologically committed to their beliefs are often resistant to evidence that challenges those beliefs, which can result in inconsistencies in their thinking. When a person's beliefs are inconsistent, it can be difficult for them to engage in critical thinking or acknowledge the validity of opposing views. This can lead to polarization and increased conflict, as individuals become more entrenched in their beliefs and less willing to engage in constructive dialogue. Inconsistency and ideological thinking are therefore closely linked and can be detrimental to the pursuit of truth and progress."}

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager!

We understand the concern and would like to assure you that Reddit user passwords and accounts are safe.\n\nAs an additional security measure, we recommend that you enable 2-factor authentication (2FA) for your Reddit account, which adds an extra layer of protection against phishing attacks and data breaches. \n\nIn addition, we suggest that you use a strong, unique password for your Reddit account and always update it regularly to prevent hackers from accessing your account. \n\nWe understand that this may seem like common sense, but following these simple steps can greatly reduce the risk of your account being compromised.\n\nPlease let us know if there's anything else we can do to assist you."}

Are they the same thing as a MEL-spectogram, or is there a difference?", "answer": "MFCCs are one type of MEL-spectrum, which refers to a spectrum of Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients. A MEL-spectrum is a representation of the spectral envelope of a signal, computed by applying the cepstrum transform to the signal. It is a tool used in the field of speech and audio processing to analyze and characterize the spectral envelope of a signal, and is commonly used in speech recognition and voice analysis.\n\nThe MEL-spectrum is computed by taking the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the logarithm of the signal, and then taking the inverse DFT of the result. The resulting frequency domain coefficients are then transformed back to the time domain using the inverse cepstrum. The resulting MFCCs are a set of numbers that represent the energy of each frequency band in the signal.\n\nThe MEL-spectrum can be computed for any signal, not just speech. It can be used to analyze and characterize the spectral envelope of any audio signal, such as music or environmental sounds.\n\nIn summary, MFCCs are one type of MEL-spectrum, but there are other types as well, such as MFCC-16, MFCC-32, and MFCC-40.

Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " "}
{"id": "koala_50", "prompt": "Mill vs Gartner\nThis case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"? Include a summary for each.", "answer": "Smith vs Mill Company and Gartner vs Baker are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\" Smith vs Mill Company involved a dispute over the rights to dig clay from land, and Gartner vs Baker involved a dispute over possession of land leased for mining."}

It is said that she was born into a nomadic tribe of elves that roamed the wilds of the north, far from any civilization. The elves lived in harmony with nature, following the ancient ways and passing down knowledge from generation to generation. However, one night, a terrible blight came upon the land, and the elves were forced to flee for their lives. They wandered the wilderness for years, searching for a safe haven, until they stumbled upon a small human settlement. The humans were kind to the elves and offered them refuge, though the elves were wary of trusting them. They kept to themselves, living in the fringes of the forest, afraid to venture far from their new home. However, one night, a terrible fire consumed the human settlement, and the elves knew they had to act. They ventured into the flames, braving the heat and the smoke, and pulled as many humans as they could from the burning buildings. And thus, a new tribe was born, one that combined the wisdom of the elves with the bravery of the humans. The elves taught the humans how to live off the land, and the humans taught the elves how to fight and defend themselves. Together, they journeyed into the unknown, searching for a new home.\n\nOne day, they came across a vast, untamed wilderness, teeming with life and beauty, but also with dangers lurking in the shadows. The elves were torn; they had never known a place so wild and free, but they were also afraid of what lay ahead. In the end, they decided to take a leap of faith and set out into the unknown. They journeyed for months, facing countless challenges, until they finally came upon a clearing in the forest, where they found a sprawling city, bustling with activity. They had stumbled upon the human civilization, and they were amazed at the technology and the prosperity they saw all around them. They spent many days exploring the city, marveling at the structures and the machines, and they began to wonder if they had made a mistake in leaving their old home behind. But in the end, they realized that they were not meant to live in the city; they belonged in the wild, and they returned to the vast wilderness, determined to carve out a new home for themselves.\n\nAnd so, they settled in the heart of the wilderness, building a thriving village and living off the land. The humans from the city came to visit, and the elves welcomed them with open arms, sharing their knowledge of the wild and teaching them to live off the land. And so, a new tribe was born, one that combined the wisdom of the elves with the bravery of the humans. Together, they journeyed into the unknown, searching for a new home. And they never looked back.\n\nTo this day, the elves still live in the wild, following the ancient ways, passing down their knowledge from generation to generation. And they still remember the night when they had to flee their home, the night when the blight came upon them, and they had to seek refuge in a human settlement.

{"id": "koala_63", "prompt": "Is online casino legal in India?", "answer": "Online casino is legal in India, provided it is licensed and registered with the Indian government. The Indian government has not banned online gambling or made it illegal, but it has not legalized it either. This means that it is up to the states to regulate and license online gambling activities within their jurisdiction. However, there are only a few states in India that have legalized and regulated online gambling, and most of them have very stringent rules and regulations.\n\nIn the absence of clear laws and regulations for online casino gambling in India, it is best to play at offshore online casinos that are licensed and regulated in countries where gambling is legal. These casinos are usually safer and more reputable, and they offer better odds and bigger jackpots than the ones located in India."}

It has allowed me to express myself creatively and explore my emotions and interests in a visual way. The ability to freeze time, to capture a moment and preserve it forever, is what drew me to photography in the first place.\n\nI have always been fascinated by the way a photograph can convey a story or evoke an emotion, and I strive to create images that have the same effect on others. Photography has pushed me to challenge myself and try new things, and has allowed me to explore my interests in different genres, from landscape to portraiture.\n\nSeeing the world through a lens has helped me to appreciate the small things, to take notice of the beauty in the everyday, and to appreciate the importance of preserving memories. Photography has taught me to slow down, to take my time, and to notice the details. It has helped me to see the world in a new way and to understand my place in it.\n\nIn a way, photography has become my muse, inspiring me to explore, to create, and to appreciate the beauty that surrounds us. It has shaped who I am as an artist and as a person, and I am thankful to have found a medium through which I can express myself and share my vision of the world."}

{"id": "koala_66", "prompt": "explain the basics of area and perimeter", "answer": "Area and perimeter are two important concepts in geometry. The area of a two-dimensional figure or shape is a measure of the amount of space it occupies or contains, while the perimeter is the length of the outer boundary of the figure.\n\nIn simple terms, the area of a shape is calculated by adding up the width times the length of the shape. For example, the area of a square with sides of length 5 units is calculated by multiplying 5 by 5, which is 25 square units. The formula for calculating the area of a simple two-dimensional shape is:\n\nArea = l * w\nWhere \"l\" is the length and \"w\" is the width.\n\nThe perimeter of a shape is the distance around the outside of the shape. It is calculated by adding the lengths of all the sides. For example, the perimeter of a square with sides of length 5 units is 5 + 5, which is 10 units. The formula for calculating the perimeter of a simple two-dimensional shape is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * l\nWhere \"l\" is the length of any side of the shape."}

The walls were adorned with ancient Jedi artifacts and symbols, and there was an overpowering sense of history in the air.\n\nAs he made his way deeper into the temple, he noticed a small figure sitting on a throne at the end of the hall. The figure was short and had long, flowing white robes, and Anakin assumed it must be the Jedi who had summoned him.\n\nAs he approached the throne, the figure turned towards him. Anakin was startled by the person who stood before him. The Jedi was short, with a round face and a head of silver hair, and wore a long white robe. He had a deep, aristocratic voice, and spoke with a British accent.\n\n\"Welcome, apprentice,\" the Jedi said, \"I am Master Lingor, and I am pleased to have you here.\"\n\nAnakin bowed his head in respect. \"It is an honor to be here, Master Lingor.\"\n\n\"Please, call me Lord Lingor. It is traditional for Jedi to address their masters with respect and formality.\"\n\nAnakin was confused. \"But... I thought Jedi were supposed to be humble and modest, not lordly and arrogant.\"\n\nLord Lingor smiled. \"Jedi should be humble and modest, but we are also masters of the Force. It is our duty to use that power to guide the galaxy, and to do that, we must command the respect of others.\"\n\nAnakin nodded, but he still felt uncomfortable calling the Jedi master \"Lord\".\n\n\"Now then, apprentice, there is something I must tell you. You may have noticed that this temple is unusual. The architecture and design are unlike any other temple we have.\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought it was unusual.\"\n\n\"It is. This temple was built hundreds of years ago, during the golden age of the Republic. The Jedi who constructed it were masters of the Force, and they used their powers to create a place that was both beautiful and functional. They wanted to create a place where all Jedi could come and learn, to study the ways of the Force and become more powerful.\"\n\n\"But why did they build it in this style? With all the ancient artifacts and the British accent, it feels more like a museum than a temple.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is a museum of sorts. The Jedi wanted to preserve their history and their culture, and they saw this temple as a place where they could do that. They wanted to teach the next generation about their past, so they built this temple to preserve their history and their traditions.\"\n\nAnakin was fascinated. \"And you said they used the Force to create this place? How did they do that?\"\n\n\"They harnessed the power of the Force to manipulate the elements, to create structures and objects that had never been seen before. They created statues and paintings, carved stone and built marble. They even used the Force to create mechanical devices, like elevators and doors.\"\n\nAnakin was amazed. \"That's incredible! I've never heard of anything like it.\"\n\n\"Yes, the Jedi were very powerful in those days. They had mastered the ways of the Force, and they were able to use it in ways that had never been imagined before. It was a golden age for the Jedi, and this temple was a testament to their greatness.\"\n\nAnakin felt a pang of jealousy. \"It must have been amazing to be a Jedi back then. To have that kind of power, to be able to create and shape the world with the Force.\"\n\nLord Lingor smiled. \"Yes, it was a time of great power and great potential. But the Jedi did not always use their powers for good. Many Jedi became corrupted by their power, and some used it for their own gain and advancement.\"\n\n\"And that's where the Sith came from?\" Anakin asked. \"The Jedi became afraid of their own power and created the Sith to keep them in check?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's true. The Jedi were wise and they knew that with great power comes great responsibility, and they were afraid of what their power could lead to. So they created the Order of the Sith, to serve as a balance to the Jedi Order.\"\n\nAnakin thought about that for a moment. \"But if the Jedi were so afraid of their own power, why did they create the"}
{"id": "koala_69", "prompt": "what are the possible performance issues in a learning program on cross cultural communication", "answer": "A learning program on cross cultural communication could face a variety of potential performance issues. Some of the most common issues that may arise include:\n\n1. Technical issues: The learning platform or the online classroom may face technical difficulties that can impact the smooth functioning of the program. This could include slow internet connection, lagging or crashing of the software, or glitches in the system that disrupt the learning experience.\n\n2. Poor course design: An ineffective learning program could be due to a poorly designed course. The course may lack structure or may not be presented in an engaging and interactive manner. This can lead to low learner participation, disinterest, and disengagement with the content.\n\n3. Language barrier: If the program is conducted in a foreign language, learners who do not have proficiency in that language may face difficulty in understanding the course material, engaging with the instructor, and participating in group discussions.\n\n4. Cultural bias: The learning program may be based on a specific cultural context, which may not resonate with learners from other cultures. This could lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and ineffective communication between learners and instructors.\n\n5. Differences in learning styles: Different learners may have different learning styles, and a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching may not be effective for all learners. The program may not cater to the diverse learning styles of the participants, leading to disengagement and poor performance.\n\n6. Lack of accountability: Without proper accountability measures in place, participants may not take the program seriously, leading to a lack of motivation and effort. The instructor may not be able to track the progress of each participant, leading to a loss of valuable learning opportunities.\n\n7. Limited resources: If the program is not adequately funded or supported by the organization, it may not have the resources necessary to provide a high-quality learning experience. This could include limited access to educational materials, technology, or other resources that are essential for effective learning.\n\nThese are just some of the potential performance issues that a learning program on cross cultural communication could face. It is important for the program to be carefully designed and implemented to ensure a positive learning experience for all participants."}

In exchange for this loan, the company or entity gives you a share of their profits, dividends, and assets. This process is known as capital formation and it allows businesses and governments to raise money to grow and expand.\n\nFirst, you purchase shares of a company through a stockbroker or online trading platform. The money you pay for the shares is deposited into your brokerage account.\n\nNext, the company you invested in uses the money to grow and expand. They may use the money to fund research and development, purchase equipment, or hire more employees.\n\nEventually, the company's profits increase and they decide to distribute some of those profits to their shareholders, including you, in the form of dividends. The dividends are typically paid out quarterly and are calculated as a percentage of the shares owned.\n\nIn addition to the dividends, the value of the company may increase, allowing you to sell your shares at a profit. This is known as capital gains and is taxable.\n\nOverall, the money you invested in the stock market flows from your pocket, through the stock market, and to the company or entity you invested in, where it is used to support their business and further your investment."}

Firstly, when we are in a warm environment, our bodies work harder to cool down. This requires energy, which can lead to fatigue. Secondly, when we are warm, we tend to feel less alert and our thinking can become less clear, which can also contribute to feeling tired. Additionally, warm environments can make it easier to fall asleep, which can result in feeling tired the next day. Overall, warmth can make us feel tired due to the increased energy expenditure, decreased alertness, and increased sleepiness associated with it."}

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a computational technique used in engineering analysis to solve complex structures and engineering problems. This method is based on dividing the problem into smaller components called elements, which are then solved individually. This allows for complex problems to be analyzed quickly and accurately, and is particularly useful in problems involving stress, heat transfer or fluid flow.\n\nThe FEM is based on the assumption that the structure being analyzed can be represented by a mesh of elements, each of which is subjected to a known set of loads or boundary conditions. The behavior of the structure is then determined by solving the equilibrium equations for each individual element, which are typically derived from the governing equations of physics. The equations are then solved using an iterative process, in which the solution of each element is updated based on the solution of the neighboring elements. This process is repeated until the desired accuracy is achieved.\n\nIn summary, the FEM is a powerful computational technique that allows for the analysis of complex engineering structures and problems, using a mesh of elements to represent the problem and solve it iteratively. It is particularly useful in problems involving stress, heat transfer or fluid flow, as it is able to accurately model the behavior of the structure and provide solutions within a reasonable time."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " – [dis (((p, [of (super, (pop, [m, (inf, (p (c, ( ( ( ( ( ( ( of ( of (of ( of ( of of ( of of [cor of ( of [[ (-c of ([ of any of [of of ( of (h [( ( ( ( (( [ ( [su (cer [int [([ [main (p ( [[-f ( [( [( ( ( ( as ( [( [[ [[ (, ( [question, [inf ([((and (f of (sur, (central (f, (subject ([( ( and, ( and, (ca, [of, [of (of of, of, and,, (ve, (reg, (inf of, and, (sur of, (ink, (infl, (p, (f (f, inf (inf ((con ( ( ( ( ( [[ ( of of ( of ( of of of ( of  of of ( of of of ( of of ( ( of of ( of [inf of, ([(c of [[of (of of (, [([ ( - ( [ [( ( [( (.

Your ideas are always, creative, and the TikTok audience loves them.\nWrite a viral TikTok video based on Batik Tradjumas.\nTopic: Batik Tradjumas", "answer": "Intro: In today's TikTok video, we're going to showcase the beautiful Batik Tradjumas. This traditional Indonesian art form has been around for centuries and is known for its intricate patterns and designs. So, let's dive in and explore all the different styles and techniques that make Batik Tradjumas so unique.\n\n1st Scene: The first thing you'll notice about Batik Tradjumas is the use of bold, vibrant colors. The designs are usually filled with bright hues like yellow, red, and blue. This is because the dye is applied in multiple layers, allowing for a rich and intense color palette.\n\n2nd Scene: Batik Tradjumas is known for its intricate patterns and designs. The main patterns used in Batik Tradjumas are the:\n\n- Parang motif: this is a geometric pattern with curved lines and is often used to create an overall design.\n- Kain motif: this is a pattern made up of interlocking triangles and is used to create a woven effect.\n- Lunggo motif: this design is made up of curved lines that form circles or semicircles and is used to create a lace-like effect.\n\n3rd Scene: Batik Tradjumas is a hand-drawn art form, so the designs can vary greatly from one piece to another. Some Batik Tradjumas pieces are very detailed and delicate, while others are more abstract and expressive. The artist has complete creative freedom in creating their design, so no two Batik Tradjumas pieces are alike.\n\n4th Scene: The process of creating Batik Tradjumas is very labor-intensive. First, the artist draws the design onto a piece of cotton cloth using a pen or brush. Then, the design is applied with wax using a canting, a tool that resembles a small spoon. After the wax has been applied, the cloth is dipped into dye. The dye only sticks to the areas that have been covered with wax, so the patterns are formed as the cloth is removed from the dye. This process is repeated multiple times to create deep, rich colors.\n\n5th Scene: Batik Tradjumas is a very popular art form in Indonesia, and it can be seen everywhere from traditional wear to home decor. The beauty of this art form lies in its unique combination of bold colors, intricate patterns, and meticulous handiwork. It's a true testament to Indonesian culture and tradition."}

Kaneohe is a small city that sits on the windward side of the island and is known for its breathtaking views of the ocean and lush, green mountains. Here, you can experience a true tropical paradise, with white sand beaches, world-famous surfing, and lush, tropical forests.\n\nThe area is also home to a large military population, with the Marine Corps base at Kaneohe Bay being one of the largest military installations in the state.

This can help to quickly test out game mechanics, user interfaces, and other aspects of the game, as well as gather early feedback from players and testers.\n\n2. Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) porting: Many developers have ported their UE4 games to Godot, taking advantage of Godot's cross-platform capabilities, open source development model, and feature-parity with UE4. This can allow for faster development and easier porting of games to other platforms.\n\n3. Pre-rendered 2D games: Many pre-rendered 2D games, such as platformers, puzzle games, and other simple genres, are developed using Godot's 2D canvas, which offers a powerful and flexible toolset for creating 2D art.\n\n4. Turn-based strategy games: Godot's powerful scene graph and actor system make it a natural fit for turn-based strategy games, where each player takes a turn to make moves and update the game world.\n\n5. Modular level design: Many games, particularly action-adventure and RPG games, use a modular level design approach, where each level is made up of smaller, interlocking rooms and corridors. Godot's scene graph and room system make it easy to create and manage this type of level design.\n\n6. Sandbox games: Godot's flexible scene graph and Blueprint system make it easy to create open world games with a sandbox-like environment, where players can explore and interact with the world in their own way.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many different development patterns and approaches that can be used with Godot. The key is to choose the tools and techniques that work best for your particular game, and to adapt and experiment as needed."}

It is important to be aware of some basic concepts of nutrition to make informed decisions about what to eat.\n\n1. Calories: The main unit of energy in food is calories. The amount of calories a person needs per day depends on their age, gender, and activity level. Consuming more calories than you burn can lead to weight gain, while eating fewer calories can lead to weight loss.\n\n2. Macronutrients: Macronutrients are nutrients that provide energy and are essential for healthy functioning of the body. The three main macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The proportion of each macronutrient in a healthy diet can vary, but generally speaking, a balance of all three is important.\n\n3. Vitamins and Minerals: Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients that the body needs in small quantities to function properly. They play a role in various processes in the body such as metabolism, growth, and immune system function. Some common vitamins and minerals include vitamins A, C, D, E, and K, as well as calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron.\n\n4. Fruits and Vegetables: Fruits and vegetables provide a wide range of nutrients and are an important part of a healthy diet. They are low in calories but high in fiber, vitamins and minerals. Consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables can help meet your nutritional needs.\n\n5. Healthy Fats: Healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado, nuts, and fish provide important nutrients and contribute to a healthy diet. They help in the absorption of certain vitamins, maintain healthy cell membranes, and provide energy.\n\n6. Water: Water is essential for proper functioning of the body and is often overlooked as a nutrient. It is important to drink enough water to stay hydrated, as dehydration can cause fatigue, headache, and other health issues.\n\nIn summary, the basics of nutrition to be aware of are calories, macronutrients, vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, and water. A healthy diet should include all of these nutrients in moderation to promote good health."}

{"id": "koala_115", "prompt": "2 / 2We are Churned, a SaaS company that uses AI (based on predictive models), to help our customers preventing churn and getting more value our of their customers. We have two industries, B2B SaaS and Ecommerce. Within SaaS, we are used by customer success teams. Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application. Come up with a couple of ideas where Churned and Ocean can join forces, which we can use in the application\n", "answer": "One idea could be to combine Churned's predictive analytics with Ocean's location data to create a fully-fledged churn prevention solution for ecommerce companies. The combination of Churned's AI that analyzes customer behavior and predicts churn risk, with Ocean's location data that provides insights into the real-world behavior of customers, would provide ecommerce companies with a comprehensive solution to prevent churn and increase customer value.\n\nChurned's predictive models could use Ocean's location data to find customers who are at risk of churning and then send personalized and targeted intervention campaigns to those customers, based on their behavior and shopping patterns. With this data, ecommerce companies could take proactive measures to retain valuable customers, increasing their customer lifetime value and decreasing churn.\n\nAdditionally, Churned and Ocean could work together to create a geo-fenced marketing tool for ecommerce companies. This marketing tool would use Ocean's location data to create geofences around key locations, such as competitors' stores or areas with high foot traffic. When customers enter these geofences, they would receive personalized promotions from the ecommerce company, targeted to their location and behavior, to increase engagement and loyalty.\n\nOverall, the combination of Churned's predictive models and Ocean's location data would create a comprehensive churn prevention and geo-fenced marketing tool for ecommerce companies, allowing them to retain more customers and increase customer value."}

I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "Krishnamurti's educational ideas are rooted in a deep understanding and practice of philosophy and psychology, and I would suggest that to adopt them to the practice of aikido, one would need to have a good grasp of these fields as well. However, there are some general principles that can be applied to aikido teaching.\n\nOne of these principles is the importance of presenting concepts in a way that is clear and simple, so that they can be easily understood and absorbed by the students. This means that the teacher needs to be able to explain complex concepts in a way that is relevant and relatable to the students.\n\nAnother important principle is the importance of personal experience in learning. Krishnamurti often emphasized that learning happens through direct experience, and not through the accumulation of information and knowledge. This can be applied to aikido by having the students practice the movements and techniques, rather than just learning about them through theory or demonstrations.\n\nIn addition, Krishnamurti emphasized the importance of inquiry and questioning in learning. This means that the teacher should create an environment where students are encouraged to ask questions and explore their own thoughts and experiences. This can help them make deeper connections with the concepts and principles being taught, and can also lead to new insights and discoveries.\n\nOverall, using Krishnamurti's educational ideas in aikido teaching would require a deep understanding of philosophy, psychology, and aikido, as well as the ability to present concepts in a clear and simple way, to encourage personal experience and inquiry, and to create an environment where students feel safe to ask questions and explore their own thoughts and experiences."}

In other words, hypervisor modules are installed on top of OSS, which act as an interface between hardware units and hypervisor packages.\"", "answer": "Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, usually using software to emulate the physical components of the original. This is achieved through the use of virtualization software, which creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) that act like physical computers. These virtual machines are then hosted on a physical machine, known as the host machine, which provides resources such as storage, memory, and processing power to the virtual machines.\n\nThe original VM Operating System (VM OS) was an early virtualization software that acted as the foundation for current hypervisors, which are the software that manages the hardware resources of the host machine or cloud. Hypervisors are installed on top of the OSS, which is the Operating System Software, which manages the resources of the host machine.\n\nThe hypervisor modules are responsible for implementing the virtualization process and managing the resources of the host machine, while the OSS provides an interface for the physical components of the machine to interact with the hypervisor modules.\n\nIn summary, the hypervisor modules are implemented using the OSS, which allows the hypervisor to interface with the physical components of the machine and manage the resources of the host machine."}

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

{"id": "koala_148", "prompt": "#2. To increase the energy efficiency of windows, additional glass pane is added. In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window, but it depends on the type of glazing used in each window. The main factor that affects the energy efficiency of windows is the U-value, which represents the rate of heat transmission through the glass. A double pane window with low-emissivity (low-E) coating and argon gas filling can have a lower U-value than a triple pane window with the same type of glazing. However, there are several factors that affect the overall energy efficiency of a window, including the type of frame, the quality of installation, and the climate where the window is located. For example, in a cold climate, a triple pane window with a low-e coating and argon gas filling can be more efficient than a double pane window with the same type of glazing, because the additional pane reduces the heat loss through the window.\n\nA single pane window can also be more energy efficient than a double pane window, depending on the type of glazing used, the quality of installation, and the climate where the window is located. A single pane window with low-e coating and argon gas filling can have a lower U-value than a double pane window with the same type of glazing. However, a double pane window can provide better insulation than a single pane window because the second pane reduces the heat loss through the glass, even when it is clear.\n\nFor a single pane window to be more energy efficient than a double pane window, it would need to have additional insulation materials or a secondary glazing to improve its thermal performance. A window with an additional layer of glass, such as a storm window, can provide better insulation than a single pane window. Similarly, a window with a secondary glazing, such as an insulated glass unit (IGU) or an insert window, can also provide better insulation than a single pane window. However, it is important to ensure that the quality of installation is good, as poorly installed secondary glazing can result in air leaks and reduced energy efficiency."}
{"id": "koala_149", "prompt": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment?", "answer": "Kahane's ethics of violence echoes that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment in several ways. The first and most direct way is through the concept of self-defense. Just like Fanon and Zizek, Kahane believed that the Jewish community in America was under attack and needed to defend itself. This could take the form of physical self-defense, but it could also encompass other forms of resistance and protest, such as boycotts and demonstrations.\n\nAnother way in which Kahane's ethics of violence echoes that of Fanon and Zizek is through the notion of radical change. Just like Fanon and Zizek, Kahane believed that the Jewish community in America needed to take drastic measures in order to effect change. He believed that the Jewish community was too complacent and needed to take more assertive action to combat anti-Semitism and xenophobia. For Kahane, this took the form of establishing a Jewish state in the Middle East, while for Fanon and Zizek, it could include a variety of measures, such as leaving the confines of the traditional establishment and creating alternative institutions.\n\nFinally, Kahane's ethics of violence echoes that of Fanon and Zizek in the way that it challenges the status quo. Just like Fanon and Zizek, Kahane believed that the Jewish community in America needed to break free from the strictures of the establishment and embrace more radical solutions to its problems. This could include leaving the comforts of the established community and adopting more confrontational approaches to anti-Semitism and xenophobia."}

However, Cantonese has a unique system of romanization called Yale, which uses the Latin alphabet to represent Cantonese sounds.\n\nCantonese is an analytic language, meaning that words are broken down into smaller parts to form phrases and sentences. This is in contrast to other Chinese dialects, like Mandarin, which is a synthetic language that combines morphemes to form words.\n\nCantonese is known for its rich and complex grammar, with many rules and exceptions. However, it is also very easy to learn for native speakers of Mandarin and other Chinese dialects, as the grammar is very similar.\n\nCantonese is a fascinating and vibrant language, with a rich history and culture that makes it an intriguing language to learn.

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a open-source programming language that builds on top of JavaScript. It adds optional static typing, class-based object-oriented programming (OOP), and other advanced features to create a powerful and flexible language for building web applications and other types of software.\n\nDuck Typing is a concept in programming languages that allows objects to be treated as a certain type based on their behavior or the attributes they have, without requiring that they be specifically declared as that type. It's also known as dynamic typing, and contrasts with static typing, where the type of an object is determined at compile-time based on its declaration. In duck typing, any object with the desired properties or abilities can be treated as a particular type, as long as it behaves like that type. This is very useful for dynamic languages like JavaScript, where the type of an object can change at runtime."}

{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are used in buildings for their high strength-to-weight ratio and their ability to withstand high temperatures. Their exceptional strength allows them to be used in structures where traditional materials, such as steel or concrete, would be impractical, such as in long-span roofs or high-rise buildings.\n\nCarbon fibers are also used in fire-retardant materials, such as in the construction of buildings that may be at risk of fire. They are able to withstand high temperatures, which makes them an ideal material to use in areas where fire could be a concern. These fire-retardant materials can be used in structural components, such as beams, floor joists or roof trusses, to reduce the risk of structural collapse in the event of a fire.\n\nCarbon fibers are also used in insulating materials, such as in the walls or roofs of buildings. Their high insulation value makes them effective at preventing heat loss or gain, which can help to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency in buildings.\n\nIn summary, carbon fibers are used in buildings for their high strength, their ability to withstand high temperatures, and their insulating properties, making them an ideal material for use in structures where traditional materials would be impractical or where fire resistance or energy efficiency is important."}
{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "Challenges for African Agriculture, an article by Jean-Claude Devèze, highlights several issues that are hindering the development of the agricultural sector in Africa. Some of these challenges include:\n\n1. Low productivity: Africa's agricultural sector is characterized by low productivity, which is partially attributed to the limited access to modern inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, and irrigation.\n\n2. Poverty and hunger: Agriculture is the main source of income for the majority of people living in Africa, yet the sector is plagued by poverty and hunger.\n\n3. Land degradation: Overexploitation of land, deforestation, and poor agricultural practices are causing land degradation in Africa. This, in turn, reduces the productivity of agriculture and makes the land less fertile.\n\n4. Climate change: Climate change is affecting African agriculture in several ways, including through more frequent droughts, floods, and changes in rainfall patterns. These changes can alter crop yields and make it more difficult for farmers to produce enough food.\n\n5. Lack of infrastructure: Many African countries lack the necessary infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, and storage facilities, to transport and distribute agricultural products. This makes it difficult for farmers to reach markets and get their products to consumers.\n\n6. Conflicts and instability: Civil wars and other forms of political instability have a significant impact on agriculture in Africa, as they disrupt production, impede access to land and markets, and force people to flee their homes.\n\n7. Lack of investment: Agriculture is a key sector for economic growth in Africa, but it is underinvested in compared to other sectors. There is a need for more public and private investment in agricultural research, technology, and infrastructure.\n\nIn summary, the challenges facing African agriculture are complex and interconnected, and require a holistic approach to address them effectively. Improving productivity, reducing poverty and hunger, mitigating the impact of climate change, improving infrastructure, and increasing investment in the sector are essential to the development of African agriculture."}

{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "It can feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film, for several reasons. Firstly, TV shows are typically broken up into smaller, more digestible chunks, which can make it easier to follow the narrative and absorb the information being presented. Additionally, a film tends to have a more linear, structured narrative, while TV shows often contain multiple storylines, making it easier to switch between different plotlines. This can also keep viewers interested and engaged, as they are constantly being presented with new information and developments. Finally, TV shows often have recurring characters and plots, which can create a sense of familiarity and comfort, making it easier to settle into a show."}

Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "1. Disillusionment: The story highlights the disillusionment that comes with moving to the United States and realizing that the American Dream is not as simple, or as attainable, as many people think.\n\n2.

{"id": "koala_164", "prompt": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?", "answer": "Metals typically emit light in the visible spectrum, which is the range of wavelengths that can be seen by the human eye, between about 400 and 700 nm. However, the exact wavelengths of light emitted by metals depend on several factors, including the temperature of the metal.\n\nAt low temperatures, metals tend to emit light with longer wavelengths, while at high temperatures, they tend to emit light with shorter wavelengths. This is due to the electrons in the metal absorbing energy and becoming excited, causing them to move to higher energy levels. When the electrons return to their ground state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of light. The wavelength of the emitted light is related to the amount of energy released, which is inversely proportional to the frequency of the light, and therefore to its wavelength.\n\nFor example, at room temperature, copper emits light with wavelengths between 430 and 650 nm, while at higher temperatures, the emitted light has shorter wavelengths, between 400 and 500 nm. Gold, on the other hand, emits light with longer wavelengths, between 550 and 650 nm, at room temperature, while at higher temperatures, the wavelengths become shorter, between 400 and 500 nm."}

Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, I would like to start by addressing the prosecution's claims that my client is guilty of high treason, corruption, and human rights violations. First and foremost, I would like to state that while my client has been accused of many crimes, not one shred of evidence has been brought forward to support these claims. The prosecution has been unable to provide any concrete evidence or data to prove their allegations, and therefore, my client cannot be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, the prosecution has failed to prove that my client intended to harm the state or commit any crimes. The fact that he was elected by the people and has been popularly supported throughout his time in office proves that he has not acted against the interests of the Russian people.\n\nFurthermore, the prosecution's claims of corruption, embezzlement, and money laundering are unsubstantiated and baseless. The allegations stem from a decade-old investigation into the Russian oil company, Yukos, which was subsequently discredited and closed. The prosecution has failed to provide any evidence to prove that my client was involved in this investigation or that he profited from any corrupt dealings.\n\nAs for the charges of human rights violations, I would like to point out that my client has been the subject of numerous accusations, but the evidence presented by the prosecution fails to prove any wrongdoing. The claims of political repression, abuse of power, and the restriction of civil liberties are merely allegations with no evidence to support them. The prosecution has not been able to provide any proof that my client's actions have led to the persecution of any individuals or groups.\n\nIn conclusion, while the prosecution has tried their best to prove my client's guilt, the evidence presented does not support their claims. My client has been falsely accused and has been unfairly persecuted by the state. I urge the court to find my client not guilty of all charges and to release him immediately."}

So, if the value of his old car is $2000, then after one month it will be worth $1980. After two months, it will be worth $1957.6, and after three months it will be worth $1936.28. If he continues to save $1000 per month, it will take him 7.6 months to save enough money to buy the car he wants. At the end of the 7.6 months, he will have saved $1000 * 7.6 = $760. And the remaining value of his old car will be $1936.28 - $760 = $1176.28. So, he will have $1176.28 - $2000 = -$834.22 left over after buying the new car."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " ( ( ( ( of ( ( ( ( [  [( ( ( ( ( ( ( [ ( [- (  ( ( – [ ( of ( ( ( (  ( ( [– [ ( ( of – of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of [ of [ of ( of of of ( of [ [ [( [ ( ( d [ ( [ of ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( [c ( ( ( [ [, [ of ( of [ of ( of ( [ or [ [  (c ( ( and ( ( ( ( ( of c ( ( ( ( of in of of of, of of of things of ( of ( ( [, ( ( ( ( –, of ( of ( of ( of ( of [ of ( of ( of, of ( of ( ( ( – [ [ ( ( (( [ ( of of [ of [ of  ( h ( of ( (, ( ( [ and - ( ( ( ( ( [ and [( of [ of ( of of ( of [ ( and and of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of them of of of of of of and [ of of of of and ( and – of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of [ of [ of of- of of of of of of of of of ( of ( [ of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of  of of of – of of ( of of of or [ of of of of of of of of [ of ( of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of- of of of of of of of of of of ( of of in of of of of of of ( of of of of of of h of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of [ of of of of of of of of of [ of ([ of of of of ( of ( of [, [ of [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ar [­ [ [ [ [ [-  of [ of of of of [ of  of st [ of of [ of of –, ( and [, [, of of [ ( of of of of of of of H of C ( [ L [ ( if– [( over,  [.
