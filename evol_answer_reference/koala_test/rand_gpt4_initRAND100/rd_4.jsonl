{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banking regulations limit the amount of cash that banks can keep on hand for several reasons. First, it is more difficult for banks to manage cash holdings than other forms of assets, such as loans or securities. Second, cash holdings can be easily lost or stolen, which increases risk for the bank and its customers. Finally, with cash, banks have limited ability to generate income, which can impact their profitability.\n\nFor these reasons, banking regulations limit the amount of cash that banks can hold to a small percentage of their total assets. In the United States, the minimum cash reserve requirement is 10% of total assets. In addition, banks must maintain a cash reserve equal to 25% or more of the total deposits they hold, to cover potential withdrawals by customers."}

They went on a quest to find the secret of his transformation, and together they faced many trials and challenges along the way.\n\nEventually, they found the source of Hildibrand's transformation - an ancient artifact known as the Staff of Power. It had been created by a long-forgotten sage, and had the ability to change the bearer's form. Hildibrand used the Staff of Power to return to his human form, and he vowed to use its power for good.

Feel free to ask me for questions which would help you give me better suggestions.", "answer": "Congratulations on graduating in May! That's very exciting. During your time before starting your PhD, there are several options that you can consider. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. Take a gap year: You can take a year off before starting your PhD and use that time to travel, work, or pursue other interests. This may be a good option if you're feeling unmotivated or burnt out after graduating.\n\n2. Consider a master's degree: If you are interested in staying in academia, you may want to consider pursuing a master's degree in a related field. This will allow you to develop your skills and knowledge in a specific area while also giving you time to decide if a PhD is the right path for you.\n\n3. Get research experience: Many labs are willing to hire undergraduate or master’s students as research assistants to work on ongoing projects. This is a good way to gain research experience and determine if a PhD is right for you.\n\n4. Pursue an internship: You may be able to find an internship related to your field in a company or research lab. This is an opportunity to learn about potential career paths outside of academia, while also gaining valuable work experience.\n\n5.

Also include many questions and answer where the director cheer up new generations to make films , where female rights can be outstanding.", "answer": "Interview with Female Film Director,\n\nJournalist: Hello, Ms. Director, thank you for agreeing to this interview. Can you start by telling me a little about yourself and how you became a film director?\n\nFemale Film Director: Sure. My name is Jane Doe and I am a Female Film Director. I started making films when I was a teenager, and I was always fascinated by the power of the medium to create worlds and tell stories. I knew I wanted to pursue a career in filmmaking, and so I studied filmmaking at a prestigious film school. After graduation, I struggled for a while to get my break into the industry, but eventually, I got my first opportunity as an assistant director on a low-budget indie film. From there, I worked my way up the ranks, learning from some of the best filmmakers in the industry. Finally, I got the opportunity to direct my own feature film, and it was a dream come true. Since then, I have directed several more films and won several awards for my work.\n\nJournalist: That is such an inspiring story! I’m sure a lot of young women can relate to your journey. \nCan you tell me what challenges you have faced as a female film director?\n\nFemale Film Director: Sure. One of the biggest challenges for me, and for many other female film directors, has been the lack of opportunities and representation in the industry. Even though there have been some improvements in recent years, there are still far fewer female film directors than male directors. And, even when female directors do get a chance to direct a film, they often face scrutiny and criticism for their work, simply because of their gender. It can be discouraging, but I try to stay positive and keep pushing forward. I believe that if I can continue to make good films and showcase my talent, I can pave the way for other female filmmakers.\n\nJournalist: That’s great! It’s important for young women to see female film directors as role models and have someone to look up to. \nWhat advice do you have for women who want to become film directors?\n\nFemale Film Director: My advice would be to never give up on your dreams and to keep pushing forward, even when the going gets tough. Be persistent and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do it. Also, find a support system of people who share your passion and can help you along the way. Lastly, don’t be afraid to experiment and take risks. The film industry can be tough, but if you’re willing to work hard and never give up, you can achieve your dreams.\n\nJournalist: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your story with us. It was a pleasure speaking with you. \nI have one final question. What does it mean to you to be a female film director in an industry dominated by men?\n\nFemale Film Director: It means a lot to me to be a female film director, because I know how important it is to have female representation in the industry. When I was growing up, I didn’t have many female role models in the film industry, and I often felt like I didn’t belong. But now, with more female directors, I know that young girls can see themselves in my story and can dream of one day becoming a film director themselves. Being a female film director means that I have the power to inspire and influence the next generation of filmmakers, and that’s a responsibility that I take very seriously."}

Prompt=  \n\nAfter reading Lalor’s Chapter 8 as well as Goode’s explanation of curriculum evaluation necessity and models, explain what your school does to evaluate curriculum. Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.

This model is based on several key principles including:\n1. Collaboration between teachers, administrators and other stakeholders to develop, implement and evaluate curriculum.\n2. Focus on student learning and how the curriculum impacts student achievement.\n3. Clearly defined performance standards and assessments.\n4. Use of multiple sources of evidence to make data-driven decisions.\n5. Continuous improvement and reflection based on feedback.\n\nOur district administers a variety of curriculum evaluations throughout the year, including teacher and student surveys, standardized test results, classroom observations, and data analysis of student work. Each evaluation is used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the curriculum as well as to inform curriculum improvements. Additionally, our district has developed a comprehensive curriculum alignment process to ensure that the curriculum is aligned to state, district, and board standards.\n\nOverall, our district's curriculum evaluation process is highly effective in ensuring that the curriculum is aligned to standards, promotes student learning, and is continuously improved."}

{"id": "koala_25", "prompt": "Write me a 2000 word essay on a water safety engineering project.", "answer": "Water safety engineering projects aim to make water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, and oceans, safe for the public. These projects can involve a number of different activities, including the installation of barriers, the creation of warning systems, and the development of safety education programs. Engineers working on such projects must take into account a range of factors, including the type of water body, the expected usage, and the local environmental conditions. This essay will discuss a project to improve the safety of a lake in a popular tourist destination.\n\n##### Project Overview\n\nThe lake in question is located in a popular tourist destination. The lake is used for a variety of activities, including swimming, boating, and fishing. However, over the years, there have been several accidents and near misses due to unsafe conditions.\n\nThe water quality of the lake is generally good, but there is a high level of bacteria in some areas. This bacteria is caused by contamination from sewage and runoff from farms and urban areas. Periodic blooms of blue-green algae also occur, which can be harmful if ingested.\n\nThe lake is also shallow in certain areas, creating hazardous conditions for swimmers. There are also a number of natural hazards, such as submerged rocks and strong currents.\n\n\nThese safety issues have been the subject of concern for local authorities, who have been working to improve the safety of the lake. As part of this effort, a water safety engineering project was designed to address the main safety concerns.\n\n\n##### Project Development\n\nThe project was developed in consultation with local stakeholders, including the tourism authority, the police, and the local council. The objective of the project was to improve public safety and reduce the risk of accidents in the lake.\n\nThe first step was to carry out an extensive survey of the lake to identify areas of concern. This involved monitoring the water quality, taking water samples, and conducting bathymetric surveys to map the bed of the lake. This information was used to determine where the hazards were located and identify areas that were most at risk.\n\n\nThe second step was to develop options for improving safety. This involved considering a range of solutions, including the installation of barriers, the creation of warning signs, and the development of safety education programs. The options were evaluated based on their cost effectiveness, environmental impact, and ability to address the main safety concerns.\n\n\nAfter the options were finalized, a detailed design was developed and approved by the relevant authorities. Construction began in early 2022 and is expected to take several months to complete.\n\n\n\nThe project is expected to significantly improve the safety of the lake. The barriers will prevent people from entering the dangerous areas, while the warning signs and education programs will raise awareness and help to reduce the risk of accidents. The water quality will also be improved through better management of the wastewater discharge, which will decrease the frequency of algae blooms.\n\n\nOverall, the water safety engineering project is a great example of how engineers can work collaboratively with other stakeholders to improve public safety. By taking into account the local conditions and involving the relevant parties in the decision-making process, the project was able to achieve its objectives while minimizing the impact on the environment and the surrounding community."}

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "The instance segmentation AP metric measures the accuracy of an instance segmentation model at assigning a label to each pixel in an image. This can be improved through the use of human knowledge such as the knowledge of object boundaries, positioning, and orientation. Here are some tips on how to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge:\n\n1. Use pre-trained models: Using a pre-trained model can help improve the instance segmentation AP metric as it can learn from the knowledge extracted from large datasets.\n\n2. Visualize the model: Visualize the model’s predictions to understand how and where it is making mistakes. This can help identify problem areas where human intervention can be used to improve the model’s predictions.\n\n3. Use data augmentation: Data augmentation techniques such as Horizontal Flip, Random Cropping, Random Color Jitter, and Random Rotation can be used to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model’s performance.\n\n4. Use weakly supervised learning: Weakly supervised learning allows for training instance segmentation models with only bounding box annotations, which can be easier to obtain than pixel-level annotations. This can help improve the segmentation performance of models with limited data.\n\n5. Fine-tune existing models: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on your training data can help improve its segmentation performance. This can be particularly useful if you have large amounts of data with limited variations in object appearances and poses.\n\n6. Use multi-task learning: Multi-task learning can be used to train a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as instance segmentation and semantic segmentation. This can improve the overall segmentation performance of the model.\n\n7. Use post-processing techniques: Post-processing techniques such as non-maximum suppression, morphological operations, and connected component labeling can be used to improve the segmentation accuracy of instance segmentation models.\n\n8. Use region proposals: Using region proposals can help improve the instance segmentation AP metric as it can help the model focus on regions where instances are more likely to be located.\n\n9. Use bounding box regression: Using bounding box regression can improve the segmentation accuracy of instance segmentation models by predicting more accurate coordinates for the bounding boxes of the instances.\n\n10. Use semantic segmentation as a prior: Semantic segmentation can be used as a prior for instance segmentation, where the segmentation masks are used to regularize the instance segmentation model and improve its performance.\n\nOverall, improving the instance segmentation AP metric with human knowledge requires a combination of techniques, including using pre-trained models, visualization, data augmentation, weakly supervised learning, fine-tuning, multi-task learning, post-processing, region proposals, bounding box regression, semantic segmentation, and using semantic segmentation as a prior. By incorporating these techniques, it is possible to improve the segmentation performance of instance segmentation models and achieve higher AP scores."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " �..(ex in and (c in and 1 [per and (t (c ((c and [in and, and in and in, in(un in. and d �[ch in in ch and ([[ to to to to to to to to to po and and  and (  of  of d ((  and,.. and (, and , [m  in   of of of, ,., and, re and,, and ( 1,  and , st in ( and   in in, and,, 1 in, [c in in in in in [[c., 1 [at, 1, ,, �, [c (b [p ch (� (ace to as to [[[[c [c in [[[[part [my, in my [c [[(c, in inter m in at \"c [c,"}

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related concepts. Ideology is a set of principles, values, and beliefs that shape how we understand the world and our place in it. Ideological thinking is the tendency to approach issues in a way that is consistent with our ideology, regardless of the facts.\n\nIdeologies often have strict and inflexible principles, which can lead to inconsistencies when those principles are applied in specific situations. This can happen for a number of reasons. First, ideologies often fail to take into account the complexities of real-world issues, which can make it difficult to apply their principles in a way that is consistent with the facts. Second, people are often unwilling to challenge their own beliefs, even when confronted with evidence that contradicts them. This is known as cognitive dissonance, and it can lead to the rationalization or justification of inconsistencies in ideology. Finally, groups and institutions can become invested in a particular ideology, which can make it difficult for them to admit to or correct inconsistencies.\n\nInconsistency can be a red flag for ideological thinking. When an ideology is applied inconsistently or without regard for the facts, it can indicate that the ideology is being used as a means to justify or defend a particular worldview or interest, rather than as a tool for understanding and solving problems."}

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

MEL-spectogram is a representation of the magnitude spectrum of a speech signal, which is computed by taking the absolute value of the Fourier transform of the speech signal. The spectrum is then normalized such that the maximum value in the spectrum corresponds to 1.0, and the frequency axis is scaled such that lower frequencies are represented by larger values. MFCC, on the other hand, is a set of coefficients that are computed from the Mel-frequency scale of the speech signal. The MFCC coefficients are computed by applying the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the logarithm of the magnitude spectrum and then computing the mean and standard deviation of the resulting coefficients. The MFCC coefficients provide a good representation of the spectral and temporal characteristics of speech, and are commonly used in speech recognition and speech analysis."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " 1 ulsphere,  [[icical ical version, ices, theics, howificists andificical andify theictive 1igify, andistical-science and Google and 11 1ical ical igenical andical andic"}
{"id": "koala_50", "prompt": "Mill vs Gartner\nThis case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

They lived in harmony with nature and the other creatures that called the forest home.\n\nBut in the deepest part of the forest, there was a dark, evil presence lurking. This was a cult of dark magicians who sought to corrupt the elves and enslave them to their will. They used their powers to conjure up monsters to terrorize the elves and force them to give up their sacred lands. The elves fought back with their own magic and skill, but they were no match for the evil sorcerers.\n\nOne day, a young elf named Vailor was out hunting in the forest. It was a peaceful day, and he was lost in his thoughts, deep in the tranquility of the woods. Suddenly, he heard a commotion in the distance. He followed the sound, and came upon a battle being waged between the elves and the dark sorcerers. Vailor was filled with pride at the sight of his people fighting back against the evil that threatened their way of life.\n\nBut as he watched, he saw one of the dark magicians unleash a powerful spell that destroyed an entire elven village. The elves were defeated, and the dark sorcerers triumphed. Vailor was heartbroken by what he had seen. He knew that he could never just stand by and watch as his people were enslaved.\n\nSo he trained himself in the ways of the ranger, becoming a skilled warrior and an even more deadly marksman. He swore to fight against the dark sorcerers and their minions, to protect the elves and reclaim their stolen lands. No matter what dangers he might face, he would never abandon his people.\n\nAnd so, Vailor became a legend in the elven realm, known far and wide for his courage and his skill in combat. He led many brave elves in their fight against the dark sorcerers, and together they drove them from their homes. Finally, the elves were able to reclaim their lands and live in peace once more.\n\nVailor returned home a hero, and he was welcomed with love and admiration by his people. But even as he enjoyed his newfound fame and happiness, he could never forget the evil that had threatened his people, or the friends he had lost in the battle. So he continued to fight, to protect his people and to keep the dark sorcerers at bay.\n\nAnd so the legend of the half-elf ranger known as Vailor lives on to this day, a reminder of the bravery and strength of the elves, and a warning to all who would do them harm."}

Add a rubric.", "answer": "Lesson Plan for Friendship (CEFR A1 & A2)\n\nObjective: The goal of this lesson is for students to learn about the concept of friendship and its importance in our lives, as well as to practice basic conversation skills.\n\nTime: One 45-minute class period\n\nMaterials:\n- Visual aids (e.g. pictures, charts, etc.)\n- Handouts (e.g. worksheets, activities, etc.)\n- Technology (e.g. projector, screen, etc.)\n- Markers, pens, pencils\n- Copies of the worksheets and handouts\n\n1. Warm up activity: Ask students to pair up with a classmate and introduce themselves by sharing their names and a little bit about themselves.\n\n2. Instruction: Good morning/afternoon class, today we are going to learn about friendship. Friendship is a relationship between two or more people who care about each other and enjoy spending time together. Friends typically share common interests and goals, and support each other in good times and bad. Friendship is an important part of our lives, as it provides us with love, companionship, and a sense of belonging.\n\n3. Let's begin by defining the word \"friendship\". Ask students to turn to their neighbor and define the word \"friendship\". Afterwards, as a class, write the word \"friendship\" on the board and brainstorm a list of synonyms, such as \"bond\", \"relationship\", \"love\", and \"support\".\n\n4. Next, ask students to think about their friends and what they value most about their friendships. As a class, write down students' ideas on the board, such as loyalty, trust, understanding, and support.\n\n5. Now let's take a look at the different types of friendships. There are several different types of friendships, including: \n\n- Close friends: These are friends who know each other well and share similar interests and goals. They spend a lot of time together, and often rely on each other for support and advice.\n\n- Acquaintance friends: These are friends that you know casually, through work, school, or other activities. They may not know each other as well, but they still enjoy spending time together.\n\n- Best friends: These are friends who are extremely close and share everything with each other. They know each other better than anyone else, and trust each other completely.\n\n- Online friends: These are friends that you may never meet in person, but who you connect with through social media or other online platforms. They may share common interests or goals, and keep in touch through messages, chats, or video calls.\n\n- Group friends: These are friends who are part of a larger group, such as a sports team or a club. They may not know each other as well as close friends, but they still enjoy spending time together and supporting each other.\n\n- Friendly acquaintances: These are friends who you know casually, but who you don't spend a lot of time with. They may share a few common interests, but don't usually confide in each other or rely on each other for support.\n\n- Fair-weather friends: These are friends who only want to spend time with you when it's convenient for them. They may enjoy your company at first, but when you need them, they are nowhere to be found.\n\n- Enemy friends: These are friends who may seem like friends at first, but who end up hurting or betraying you in some way. They may be jealous or competitive, and often use your friendship to their advantage.\n\n6. Finally, let's talk about the importance of friendship. Friends can help us in many ways, such as: \n\n- Providing support and encouragement: Friends can provide emotional support and encouragement when we are feeling down or facing difficult situations.\n\n- Sharing common interests: Friends with similar interests can share their passions and learn from each other.\n\n- Building confidence: Friends can help us overcome our fears and build confidence in ourselves.\n\n- Instilling values: Friends can influence our behavior and help us to form good habits and values.\n\n- Creating memories: Friends can create lasting memories by sharing their experiences together.\n\n- Providing a sense of belonging: Friends can help us feel like we belong and are part of a larger community.\n\n- Enhancing happiness: Friends can increase our happiness and overall well-being by providing companionship and laughter.\n\nIn summary, friendship is an important part of our lives, and can provide numerous benefits."}

He had never seen a Jedi who looked or acted like this before.\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.\n\nThe Jedi bowed. \"Forgive me, young Padawan, I didn't mean to startle you. My name is Obi-Wan Kenobi, and I am an old friend of your master, Qui-Gon Jinn.\"\n\nAnakin was overwhelmed with excitement. He had heard so much about Obi-Wan Kenobi, but he had never met him before. \"Master Jinn said you were the greatest Jedi Knight who ever lived,\" he said. \"It's an honor to finally meet you, Obi-Wan Kenobi.\"\n\nObi-Wan smiled. \"Please, call me Obi-Wan. If Master Jinn said I was the best, then it must be true.\"\n\nAnakin could hardly believe his ears. Here was the most famous Jedi in the galaxy, and he was talking to him like they were old friends.\n\nObi-Wan continued. \"I hope you don't mind, but I wanted to introduce myself to you before your master returned. I figured that since you two are so close, it would be easier for him to explain our meeting.\"\n\nAnakin was confused. \"Master Jinn isn't here?\"\n\nObi-Wan nodded. \"He's gone on a mission to the planet Dagobah. He should be back in a few weeks.\"\n\nAnakin's heart sank. He had always looked up to Master Jinn, and now he would never get to meet him.\n\nObi-Wan must have sensed his sadness. \"Don't worry, Anakin, I'm sure Master Jinn will be back before you know it. In the meantime, I hope you'll let me show you around the Temple and introduce you to some of my friends.\"\n\nAnakin brightened at the thought. \"Yes, please! I would love that.\"\n\nObi-Wan smiled. \"Then follow me.\""}
{"id": "koala_69", "prompt": "what are the possible performance issues in a learning program on cross cultural communication", "answer": "There are several potential performance issues that can arise in a learning program on cross cultural communication. Here are a few common ones:\n\n1. Lack of Relevance: One potential performance issue that can arise in a learning program on cross cultural communication is a lack of relevance. If the learning content is not applicable to the participants' work context or does not address their specific cross cultural communication needs, then it is unlikely that they will engage with the learning and see the value in it.\n\n2. Poor Instructional Design: Another potential performance issue that can arise in a learning program on cross cultural communication is poor instructional design. This can present as confusing or unclear learning objectives, uninspiring or ineffective content delivery methods, or a lack of engaging activities to promote learner participation. If the learning program is not designed well, participants may not understand or be able to apply the material, leading to poor performance.\n\n3. Inadequate Facilitation: Another potential performance issue that can arise in a learning program on cross cultural communication is inadequate facilitation. This can present as a lack of engagement on the part of the facilitator, an inability to manage the group dynamics, or a failure to provide constructive feedback to participants. If the facilitator is not skilled or effective in their delivery, it can have a negative impact on the performance of the participants.\n\n4. Poor Technology: Another potential performance issue that can arise in a learning program on cross cultural communication is poor technology. This can present as technical difficulties with the platform or tools being used, unreliable internet connection, or slow loading speeds. If the technology is not working properly, participants may experience frustration and disruption to their learning, leading to poor performance.\n\n5. Poor Participant Preparation: Another potential performance issue that can arise in a learning program on cross cultural communication is poor participant preparation. This can present as a lack of interest or motivation on the part of the participants, a failure to complete any pre-work or homework assignments, or a lack of knowledge or understanding of the learning topic. If the participants are not adequately prepared, it can have a negative impact on their performance in the learning program.\n\nOverall, there are many potential performance issues that can arise in a learning program on cross cultural communication, and it is important to monitor and address them throughout the program to ensure that participants are able to achieve the intended learning outcomes."}

It aims to disrupt traditional finance by creating a more inclusive, transparent, and efficient financial system.\n\nDerivative protocols are the technical architectures that enable the issuance, servicing, trading, and settlement of derivatives on public blockchain infrastructure. They provide a set of standardized rules for the creation and trading of financial instruments and are used by decentralized exchanges, debt markets, and on-chain asset management.\n\nThe protocol layer (Layer 3) provides standards for specific use cases such as decentralized exchanges, debt markets, derivatives, and on-chain asset management. These standards are usually implemented as a set of smart contracts and can be accessed by any user (or DeFi application). As such, these protocols are highly interoperable.\n\nThe protocol layer is divided into two sublayers: the protocol specification layer (Layer 3a) and the protocol implementation layer (Layer 3b). The protocol specification layer defines the technical specifications for the protocol, while the protocol implementation layer provides the actual implementation of the protocol.\n\n\nProtocol Specification Layer (Layer 3a)\n\n1. The protocol specification layer (Layer 3a) defines the technical specifications for the protocol, including the architecture, data structures, interface, and rules for implementation. This layer also defines the standards for the issuance, servicing, trading, and settlement of derivatives, as well as the mechanisms for managing counterparty risk.\n\n2. The smart contract architecture defines the structure of the smart contracts that implement the protocol. Smart contracts are self-executing computer code that can be deployed on a public blockchain to facilitate the execution of pre-defined business logic. They are programmed to execute specific tasks when certain conditions are met, making them a key component of decentralized finance protocols.\n\n3. The market data protocol specifies the formats and structure of data exchanged between the protocol and the applications that use it. This data includes the underlying asset, contract specification, and market data, such as the notional amount, strike price, expiration date, payout mechanism, and other relevant details.\n\n4. The contract specification defines the structure of the smart contracts that implement the protocol. This includes the function of the contract, data types, variables, and transaction flow.\n\n5.

The mastoid air cells are unremarkable in signal.\n\nNo abnormal enhancement.\n\nNo mass effect, midline shift or extraaxial fluid collection.", "answer": "The MRI results indicate that there were no areas of restricted diffusion, meaning that the diffusion of water molecules was not impeded within the brain. This is usually caused by acute bleeding or injury, which was absent in this case. Additionally, there was no evidence of hemorrhage or blood clots in the brain, which are often associated with restricted diffusion. This means that the MRI can be used to rule out these conditions as potential causes of the patient’s symptoms.\n\nThe MRI also revealed no acute hemorrhages or strokes, which are caused by bleeding into the brain. However, the patient did have a history of high blood pressure, which can lead to stroke. The MRI findings suggest that the patient’s stroke was likely due to another cause, such as a blood clot or a cardiovascular event.\n\nThe MRI also showed moderate to severe cerebral atrophy, which is a loss of neurons and brain tissue that can occur due to a number of conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, or brain trauma. Additionally, there was evidence of increased signal within the white matter, which is a common MRI finding associated with cerebral atrophy.\n\nThere were also several small areas of increased signal within the white matter, which is a common MRI finding associated with cerebral atrophy. This increased signal suggests that the white matter has been damaged, which can affect the communication between neurons. However, it is not possible to tell from the MRI scan alone what caused this damage.\n\n\nFinally, there was no evidence of tumors, infections, or other abnormalities within the pituitary gland or midline structures, which are important for hormone production and regulation.\n\nIn summary, the MRI results did not show any acute conditions that could be causing the patient’s symptoms, such as stroke or hemorrhage. Additionally, the MRI did not show any evidence of a pituitary tumor or infection, which can also cause symptoms. However, the MRI did show evidence of cerebral atrophy and white matter injury, which could be contributing to the patient’s symptoms. The MRI findings suggest that the patient should be evaluated by a neurologist to determine the cause of their symptoms and to develop an appropriate treatment plan."}

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical technique used to solve for the solution of engineering problems that involve partial differential equations (PDEs). This method uses finite elements, which are discretized representations of the continuous domain, to approximate the solution of PDEs. It is a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, from mechanics to heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetics.\n\nThe FEM works by converting a PDE into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are then solved using a numerical method. The finite element discretization of the PDE is done through the introduction of a set of basis functions, which are then used to approximate the solution of the governing PDE. The basis functions can be polynomial, trigonometric, or exponential functions, and they are chosen to be compatible with the problem at hand. The approximation error associated with the finite element discretization is controlled by the choice of the number of elements and their shape.\n\nOnce the finite element discretization is defined, the solution of the ODEs can be found using a variety of numerical methods, including the finite difference method, the finite volume method, or the meshless method. The convergence of the FEM to the exact solution of the PDE depends on the choice of the basis functions, the discretization, and the numerical method used."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": ", [[s, [p ([(idea, [gener, [d, (contr, [d (per, (gener of ((inf of (w (of, of (of of [of of of of of (of of of (of of of (con (in of (of (m of [f of (C (s (m (about, [dis [h (p ((subject ([specific (p [con ([ale [[(C (h (P (p ([(h (s [-c, [(or (H ((h [P and (sur [dis, -c, (f, (supp, (infl, and and, and, [I, and of, of, of, (F of, (p, [of, [inf, and of (in of (inf, (int, (inf, (in, (In, (inf, (se, (in (In, (gener and, [of of [. of [of of of (of [of of (of of (of, of, of (of of [of (int ([or [du [c of [[[[in, (of (of, [f (c [p of int; of, [C of (per, [in, ((In (H (m,:In (In (A ink of int of (In In In of [(inc [t of (of [of [[c of (In (A In In of the (In In C (in (D (in (sen (h, (in (d, (C, [w [p, [part or, (w [-[f [part (or (c (in (sur (c, (([dis ([( ([in, [-nam ([( [c (d [c [(per (d (of (of (with (for and (-p, (inf (( ((of, of of (([((h (C (c (p (int (p, ((cont (p (of [of (-of (m, (b of (-"}

For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, instead of reacting with anger or frustration, take a deep breath and think about what you want to say or do in that moment. Are you going to yell at them? Are you going to honk your horn and risk escalating the situation? Or are you going to calmly gesture for them to move over and let you pass? By taking a moment to pause, think, and choose a more appropriate response, you can diffuse the situation and avoid any negative consequences.\n\nAnother strategy you can use to be less reactive is by practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment, without judgment, and noticing your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations. This can help you become more aware of your emotions and the way they are affecting your behavior, which can help you better manage your reactions. For example, if you tend to get angry easily, mindfulness can help you notice the early signs of anger so you can take steps to diffuse the situation before it escalates.\n\nFinally, it's important to remember that you don't have to be perfect. Everyone reacts in different ways in different situations, and it's okay to make mistakes or have lapses in your behavior. The important thing is to recognize when you're reacting negatively, and make an effort to change your behavior in the future."}

{"id": "koala_109", "prompt": "what are some basics of nutrition that i should be aware of", "answer": "Nutrition is the study of how the food we eat affects our bodies. It is a complex science that involves various nutrients, such as carbohydrates, protein, fiber, fat, vitamins, and minerals, and how these nutrients interact with our bodies. Good nutrition is important for maintaining overall health and well-being, as well as for preventing and managing various diseases and conditions. Below are some basic concepts of nutrition that you should be aware of:\n\n1. Macronutrients: These are nutrients that provide the bulk of energy for our bodies, and include carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Each macronutrient has a different role in our bodies and provides us with different nutrients.\n\n2. Micronutrients: These are nutrients that we need in small amounts, but play an important role in our health. Some examples of micronutrients include vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron.\n\n3. Nutrient density: This refers to the amount and quality of nutrients in a food. Foods that are high in nutrient density, such as fruits and vegetables, are considered to be healthy. On the other hand, foods that are low in nutrient density, such as processed foods and sugary drinks, are considered to be unhealthy.\n\n4. Food groups: There are five main food groups that provide a variety of nutrients and help achieve a well-balanced diet. These food groups are:\n- Vegetables: Vegetables are low in calories and high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are a great source of nutrients and can be eaten raw or cooked.\n- Fruits: Fruits are also low in calories and contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are a healthy and delicious way to add more fruit to your diet.\n- Grains: Grains are a rich source of carbohydrates and provide fiber. Choose whole grains over refined grains, such as brown rice or whole wheat bread, for a healthier option.\n- Protein: Protein is an essential nutrient that is found in foods such as meat, eggs, beans, and nuts. Protein helps with building and repairing body tissues, as well as cell growth and maintenance.\n- Dairy: Dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese, are a good source of calcium and protein. They can be included in your diet to promote bone health and help with muscle growth.\n\n5. Healthy cooking methods: Instead of relying on unhealthy cooking methods, such as deep frying or baking with oil, try these healthier options:\n- Steaming or grilling: Use these methods to cook vegetables, meat, or fish to preserve their nutrient content and avoid adding unhealthy fats.\n- Roasting or broiling: Instead of frying, use these methods to cook meat or vegetables, as the high heat will preserve the nutrients but reduce the fat content.\n- Baking: Use whole grain baking ingredients, such as whole wheat flour or oats, to make baked goods that are healthier and higher in fiber.\n- Boiling or poaching: Use these methods to cook foods like eggs, fish, or pasta to preserve the nutrient content and avoid adding unhealthy fats.\n\n6. Mindful eating: Eating mindfully means paying attention to the physical sensations of hunger and fullness, as well as the enjoyment of food. It can help you eat the right amount of food, and avoid overeating or eating on the go. Practice mindful eating by taking the time to chew your food, savor your meals, and stop when you are full.\n\n7. Portion control: It is important to monitor portion sizes to maintain a healthy diet. Aim for smaller portions of high-fat and high-sugar foods, and eat slowly to help you feel full faster. Also, be aware of the serving size of the foods you eat, as many packages are misleading and may contain more than one serving.\n\n8. Drinking water: Drinking enough water is important to stay hydrated and help the body function properly. Try to drink at least 8 cups of water a day.\n"}

Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application. Come up with a couple of ideas where Churned and Ocean can join forces, which we can use in the application\n", "answer": "1. Churned provides predictive models and machine learning algorithms to help customer success teams reduce churn and increase customer lifetime value. Churned's models and algorithms are trained using data from customer interactions, such as customer support tickets, customer survey answers, and sales data.\n\nOcean provides location intelligence solutions to retailers, brands, and media companies. Ocean uses location data from customers' smartphones and GPS devices to understand their real-world behavior, such as where and when they visit stores, how frequently they visit, and which competitors they are comparing. Ocean's location data can help brands understand the impact of marketing campaigns, measure the success of store remodels, and optimize in-store merchandising and promotions.\n\nBy combining Churned's predictive models and algorithms with Ocean's location data, we can create new customer insights that can help customer success teams better understand and prevent churn, as well as help marketing and ecommerce teams better understand customer behavior and optimize their marketing and merchandising strategies.\n\nFor example, customer success teams could use Churned's predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning and create a personalized plan to prevent churn. This could include reaching out to customers through in-app messaging, phone calls, or emails, or providing them with targeted offers or discounts.\n\nMarketing and ecommerce teams could use Ocean's location data to understand where their customers are visiting and how frequently, and use this data to optimize their marketing strategies. This could include adjusting their social media and digital advertising strategies based on customer visits to specific locations, or improving their in-store merchandising and promotions based on customer behavior.\n\nIn summary, by joining forces, Churned and Ocean can create new customer insights that can help businesses better understand and prevent churn, as well as optimize their marketing and merchandising strategies."}

A war crime is a criminal act that is committed during a time of war or conflict, and it violates international law and standards of morality. Examples of war crimes include torture, murder, and the deliberate targeting of civilians.\n\nNow, how do you not commit war crimes? Here are some tips:\n\n1. Follow the rules of war: International law sets out the rules for how wars should be fought and what is and is not allowed during a conflict. Make sure you understand and abide by these rules, as violating them could lead to war crimes charges.\n\n2. Avoid targeting civilians: It is a war crime to intentionally target civilians during a conflict. This includes indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations, such as bombing or shelling residential areas. Make sure your troops are aware of the rules of engagement, and that they avoid targeting civilians.\n\n3. Don't use banned weapons: Some weapons, such as chemical or biological weapons, are banned under international law. Using these weapons can lead to war crimes charges. Make sure your troops are aware of the weapons that are banned, and that they don't use them.\n\n4. Don't mistreat prisoners of war: It is a war crime to mistreat prisoners of war, including torture, abuse, and inhumane treatment. Make sure your troops are aware of the rules for treating prisoners, and that they follow them.\n\n5. Investigate and punish war crimes: All countries are legally obligated to investigate and prosecute war crimes, no matter who committed them. Make sure your troops know that they must report any suspected war crimes, and that they are punished if they commit them.\n\n6. Seek peaceful resolutions: War crimes are often committed when countries resort to violent means instead of seeking peaceful resolutions to conflicts. Make sure your country seeks peaceful solutions to conflicts, and avoids resorting to violence.\n\nIn summary, war crimes are serious crimes that can have severe consequences. By following these tips, you can help ensure that your troops do not commit war crimes, and that your country is not held responsible for them."}

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "I think that the educational ideas developed by J Krishnamurti offer a wide range of possibilities in the context of aikido practice. In his teachings, Krishnamurti emphasizes the importance of having a clear understanding of one's own process of learning and being aware of what is taking place in the present moment. This awareness can help to free the mind from habitual patterns of thinking and behavior and open up to new ways of perceiving and responding.\n\nIn aikido training, it is important to be aware of what is happening in the present moment, both in terms of your own body and behavior as well as in terms of the interaction with your partner. This awareness can help to improve your balance, coordination, and body alignment, as well as to develop a more intuitive response to the dynamic of the encounter. Furthermore, by being open to new possibilities, one can explore new ways of connecting with and moving the partner, thus enhancing the quality of the practice.\n\nIn addition, the educational ideas developed by Krishnamurti could also be useful in aikido teaching. For example, in the context of aikido classes, one could invite students to reflect on their own learning process and be aware of their thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations during the practice. This could help to deepen their understanding of the principles and techniques, and to develop more fluidity and efficiency in their movement. Additionally, it could foster a sense of community and mutual support among the students, as they share their experience and learn from each other.\n\nOverall, I think that there are many possibilities for aikido practice and teaching to be enriched by the educational ideas developed by J Krishnamurti."}

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

Countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa have developed and expanded their airports to cater to the growing demand for air travel.\n\n3. Introduction of Open Skies Agreements: Several African countries have signed open skies agreements with other countries, allowing for more airline service and competition. These agreements have led to increased passenger and cargo traffic, and reduced airfares.\n\n4. Implementation of Automation and Modernization: Several African countries have introduced or are in the process of introducing automation and modernization efforts to improve air traffic management and efficiency. These efforts include the use of satellite-based technology, implementation of new air traffic control systems, and the development of regional air traffic control centers.\n\n5.

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window, provided that it is properly installed and sealed. The reason for this is that the additional layer of glass and gas between the panes of the double pane window increases the overall thermal resistance of the window, which improves its energy efficiency. However, the triple pane window may still be more efficient if it has higher performance glass and/or better insulating properties.\n\nOn the other hand, a single pane window can be more efficient than a double pane window if it is properly insulated. This can be achieved through the use of window films, plastic window inserts, and other insulating materials. In addition, the windows must be properly sealed to prevent air leaks. However, it is important to note that a single pane window will always be less energy efficient than a double pane window, because it allows more heat flow through the glass."}
{"id": "koala_149", "prompt": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment?", "answer": "Kahane's ethics of violence echoes both Fanon's and Zizek's views on the American Jewish Establishment in several ways. \n\nFirst, like Fanon, Kahane viewed the establishment as a corrupt entity that has betrayed the Jewish people. He argued that it seeks to appease and assimilate with the dominant powers, choosing to prioritize their own safety over the survival of the Jewish people. In Kahane's view, this was a form of \"spiritual and emotional treason\" against the Jewish people. \n\nSecond, like Zizek, Kahane viewed the American Jewish Establishment as complicit in the oppression of the Palestinians. He believed that their support for a two-state solution, which he saw as a form of appeasement, only furthered the oppression of the Palestinian people. In Kahane's view, the establishment was either actively complicit in the oppression or indifferent to it, choosing to prioritize their own safety over the well-being of the Palestinian people. \n\nThird, like Fanon and Zizek, Kahane believed that the only way to bring about change was through radical action. He believed that the Jewish establishment had effectively rendered the Jewish community impotent by advocating for a non-violent approach to achieving equality with the Palestinians. He believed that only through the use of violence could the Jewish people hope to break free from the oppression they faced.\n\nIn summary, Kahane's ethics of violence echoes that of Fanon and Zizek in its view of the American Jewish Establishment as a corrupt entity that has betrayed the Jewish people, and in its call for radical action in the form of violence as the only means to bring about change."}

", "answer": "Social workers are often the first people to notice problems in the lives of others, and they use their skills and knowledge to help people overcome these challenges and reach their full potential. As a team of social workers, you have the unique opportunity to help students, families, and communities overcome a wide range of problems and achieve their goals.\nIn the book Upstream, Dan Heath explores how people can leverage their behavioral science knowledge to make better decisions, overcome obstacles, and achieve their goals. The book’s insights are powerful and can be applied to a wide range of fields, including healthcare, education, and social work.\n\nIn Upstream, Heath uses the metaphor of a river to illustrate the flow of behavioral change. In the river, the current flows from upstream to downstream, with smaller tributaries joining the main current along the way. This metaphor illustrates the concept of causality, which is a fundamental principle in behavioral science. Heath explains that behavioral change does not happen in a linear way. It’s not a case of doing something, then expecting a result, and then doing something else. Instead, behavioral change happens over time as a result of many small changes that accumulate over time.\n\nIn social work, this means that when working with clients, our focus should not be on the final outcome, but on the process of change. We should be continually assessing the client’s current situation, identifying the barriers that are preventing them from reaching their goals, and then working together to develop a plan for overcoming these obstacles. This approach recognizes that behavioral change is a complex and multi-faceted process, and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. By taking a step-by-step approach and continually evaluating progress, we can help our clients achieve their goals.\n\nAnother important concept in Upstream is the idea of framing. Framing refers to the way we perceive and communicate about a given situation. It can have a powerful influence on behavior, because it determines how we understand the problem and what actions we are willing to take to address it.\n\nIn social work, our job is often to help people overcome complex and deeply-rooted problems. This can be challenging, because it’s easy to become overwhelmed by the magnitude of the issue. Framing our work in a way that is meaningful and achievable can help us stay focused and motivated. For example, instead of describing a client’s behavior as “uncontrollable,” it may be more helpful to frame it as “challenging but manageable with the right support.” This shift in language can help us think more positively about the problem, and empower the client to take responsibility for their actions.\n\nIn Upstream, Heath also discusses the concept of “behavioral momentum”, which is the tendency for people to continue with their current behaviors, even when they are not working towards their goals. This can be a powerful force, and can make it difficult for people to change their behavior.\n\nAs social workers, it’s important to be aware of this phenomenon and consider ways to harness it to our advantage. For example, by using small wins and positive reinforcement to build momentum, we can help clients to sustain their motivation and continue making progress towards their goals.\n\nUpstream provides a wealth of insights into behavioral science and how these principles can be applied to a wide range of fields, including social work. By understanding and using these principles, we can help our clients to overcome their challenges and achieve their goals."}
{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are strong and lightweight materials that are used to reinforce composite materials in a wide range of applications, including aerospace, automotive, marine, and construction. They are used in buildings for a variety of purposes, such as to create lightweight yet sturdy structural elements, like beams and columns, and to enhance the energy efficiency of a building through insulation.\n\nIn construction, carbon fibers are used as an alternative to steel or concrete, which are heavy and require a lot of energy to produce. Carbon fibers are much lighter and can be produced more efficiently, which makes them a more sustainable material for building. They can also be used to create complex, lightweight structures that would not be possible with other materials, such as curved beams or lattice structures.\n\nCarbon fibers are also used to insulate buildings, especially in areas with cold or hot climates. They are placed between the structural elements, such as walls or floors, to increase their insulating properties, reducing heating and cooling costs. They are also used as sheathing to cover the exterior of a building, creating an air barrier that prevents energy loss.\n\nAll in all, carbon fibers have the potential to revolutionize the construction industry, enabling the creation of lightweight, energy-efficient, and aesthetically-pleasing buildings."}
{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "Challenges for African Agriculture by Jean-Claude Devèze\n\n1. Limited availability of land and water resources: Africa is the continent with the smallest amount of arable land and the scarcest freshwater resources.\n\n2. High population growth: The population of Africa is growing rapidly, with an average annual increase of 2.5%. This creates increased demands for food, water and land, and increases the pressure on already limited resources.\n\n3. Poverty and food insecurity: Nearly half of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lives in poverty, and an estimated 239 million people suffer from chronic undernourishment.\n\n4. Climate change and weather variability: Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on African agriculture, with changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, increased frequency and intensity of droughts and floods, and rising sea levels.\n\n5. Lack of infrastructure and technology: Africa has the least developed agricultural infrastructure and technological capacity compared to other regions in the world. This hinders the ability of farmers to increase productivity and adapt to the challenges faced by the sector.\n\n6. Political instability and conflict: Recurring political instability and conflict in some countries have disrupted agricultural production, infrastructure development and the investment needed to improve the sector.\n\n7. Migration and rural-urban population shifts: Rural-urban population shifts and high levels of migration have led to a reduction in the number of skilled laborers available in the agricultural sector, and an increased reliance on migrant labor. This further aggravates the challenges faced by the sector.\n\n8. Lack of access to markets: Limited access to markets for smallholder farmers hinders their ability to increase productivity and income. This is particularly true for women, who have fewer marketing opportunities than men.\n\n9. Lack of investment in agriculture: Agriculture receives the smallest share of public investment in Africa, compared to other economic sectors. This limits the ability of the sector to adapt to the challenges it faces.\n\n10. Rising costs of inputs: Higher costs of inputs such as fertilizers, seeds and credit are reducing the profitability of smallholder farmers, and making it more difficult for them to invest in their farms and adapt to the changing climate."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is a serious and ongoing issue that threatens the well-being of our planet. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change is primarily caused by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial farming. These activities lead to greenhouse gas emissions, which trap the sun's heat and cause global temperatures to rise. \n\nClimate change has already had a profound impact on our planet. Sea levels have risen, glaciers and ice sheets have retreated, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires have become more frequent and intense. \n\nIf global warming continues unchecked, the consequences will be devastating. Food production will be affected, leading to widespread hunger and poverty. Extreme heatwaves will become more common, causing increased mortality rates from heat-related illnesses. Coastal areas will be flooded, displacing millions of people. \n\nThe good news is that there are many things we can do to slow down the effects of climate change and protect our planet for future generations. These include reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, promoting renewable energy sources, and implementing sustainable farming practices. Individuals can also make a difference by adopting more sustainable lifestyles, such as reducing their carbon footprint through changes in transportation habits, diet, and energy use. \n\nThe threat of climate change is real, and it is up to all of us to take action to prevent its devastating consequences."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "There are a few possible reasons why it might feel like less effort to watch three-hour-long TV episodes back to back than a film.\n\nOne possibility is that with a film, there's a longer break between each scene, whereas with a TV show, the scenes are more closely connected and the story moves more quickly. This may make the film feel more effortful, as the viewer has to continually adjust their focus and attention between each scene. In a TV show, this process is more seamless, and the viewer may feel more engaged and absorbed in the story.\n\nAnother possibility is that with a TV show, there may be more characters, storylines, and subplots, which can make for a more complex and engaging narrative. This might make it more difficult for the viewer to follow and keep track of everything that's happening, but the payoff is often the satisfaction of watching all the pieces come together in the end. With a film, there's often a more straightforward and linear narrative, which may be easier to follow and more satisfying in the end.\n\nLastly, it could just be a matter of personal preference. Some people may find it more enjoyable to watch a TV show than a film, while others may prefer the more immersive experience of a film."}

American Dream/Disillusionment: The story explores the idea of the American Dream and how it can be perceived differently by different people. The main character, Ifemelu, grows up in Nigeria and is led to believe that moving to America will lead to a better life, full of opportunities and prosperity. However, after moving to the United States, she realizes that the reality is different and she is confronted with the harsh realities of the American society.\n\n2. Identity: Throughout the story, Ifemelu struggles with her identity and her sense of belonging. She is caught between two cultures, trying to fit in with the American society while also remaining true to her Nigerian roots. Although she is accepted by some, she is also rejected by others, and this leads her to question her own sense of self.\n\n3. Feminism: The story also deals with issues of feminism and gender equality. Ifemelu is a strong, independent woman who does not conform to society's expectations of how a woman should behave. She openly speaks her mind, confronts sexism, and pursues her dreams, challenging the gender stereotypes of the time."}

This indicates his confidence in his innocence.\n\nOverall, the evidence presented against Mr. Putin is weak, and does not constitute a convincing case for his guilt. In conclusion, I urge the court to dismiss the charges against Mr. Putin and declare him innocent."}

These clumps are called granulomas, and they can grow and spread in the affected areas. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but researchers believe that it may be an autoimmune disease where the body mistakenly attacks itself.\n\nSarcoidosis can cause a wide range of symptoms, and they may vary from person to person. Some common symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath, tiredness, and weight loss. In rare cases, sarcoidosis can affect other parts of the body, such as the heart, liver, and kidneys.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for sarcoidosis, but there are treatments that can help control the symptoms. This may involve medications such as steroids, and in some cases, surgery may be needed.\n\nIt is important to remember that sarcoidosis is a rare disease, and it only affects a small percentage of the population. However, if you have any of the symptoms listed above, it is important to see your doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms."}

{"id": "koala_168", "prompt": "write a chronology of important events related to ESG in 2022", "answer": "2022 has been a year filled with significant developments related to the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into business strategies, investment decisions and finance. Below is a chronology of some of the events that have shaped the ESG landscape in 2022.\n\n1. In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released its annual Global Risks Report, which highlighted the growing influence of climate change as a driver of global instability and economic volatility. The report ranked “failure of climate mitigation and adaptation” as the top risk for the fourth consecutive year.\n\n2. In February, the World Bank Group announced a $100 billion climate action plan, with the aim of mobilizing private sector financing to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. The plan includes the creation of a $100 billion climate-smart investment facilitation facility, which will provide technical assistance and financing to support low-carbon and climate-resilient projects in developing countries.\n\n3. In March, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted its first-ever resolution on human rights and the environment, calling on states to integrate human rights into their environmental policies and practices. The resolution recognized the importance of protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, and vulnerable groups, and emphasized the importance of ensuring that businesses respect human rights.\n\n4. In April, the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) announced the final version of its revised environmental, social and governance (ESG) guidelines, with the aim of increasing the integration of ESG considerations into investment practices. The revised guidelines include new provisions on climate risk, human rights, and gender equality, and introduce a framework for measuring the impact of investment decisions on the environment.\n\n5. In May, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and issued a communique on climate-related financial disclosures. The communique acknowledged the importance of robust and consistent climate-related disclosures, and called on the Financial Stability Board to develop recommendations on climate-related financial disclosures.\n\n6. In June, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released a report on climate change and financial stability, warning that the economic impact of climate change could be significant and long-lasting. The report highlighted the need for more action to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and called on governments to strengthen the financial sector’s ability to withstand climate-related shocks.\n\n7. In July, the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted a resolution on the integration of ESG considerations into investment practices. The resolution recognized the importance of sustainable investments for achieving decent work and sustainable development, and called on the ILO’s constituents to promote the integration of ESG factors into investment practices.\n\n8. In August, the European Union (EU) announced a new action plan on sustainable finance, with the aim of mobilizing more private capital for sustainable investment projects. The plan includes a series of measures to improve transparency and disclosure in the financial sector, and to foster sustainable investment through the development of financial products and services.\n\n9. In September, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on human rights and the environment, expressing concern about the negative impacts of climate change and the need for greater efforts to protect and promote human rights. The resolution also called on states to integrate human rights considerations into climate action plans and policies, and to protect the rights of affected communities.\n\n10. In October, the UN General Assembly held a high-level meeting on climate action, with the aim of galvanizing global action to address the climate crisis. The meeting included the launch of the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) for Business initiative, which aims to help businesses incorporate the value of nature into their decision-making.\n\nOverall, 2022 has been a pivotal year for the integration of ESG considerations into business and investment strategies. A growing body of evidence shows that sustainable investment practices can deliver financial returns, improve company performance, and address the social and environmental challenges facing our planet. With continued efforts from governments, businesses, and financial institutions, we can ensure that ESG considerations remain at the forefront of decision-making and drive meaningful progress towards a more sustainable future."}

Believing something without evidence is a form of faith, and faith is not the same as reason or logic. When it comes to matters of importance such as religion or politics, it is essential that we make informed decisions based on objective evidence and a thorough analysis of the facts. Otherwise, we may end up following false or misguided beliefs that lead to negative consequences."}

Organize family-focused Shabbat programs and events: Set up a schedule of family-oriented activities and events each month, including Shabbat meals, special Shabbat services, and educational programs geared toward children and families.\n\n2. Encourage parents to teach their children about Shabbat: Make Shabbat education a priority in the synagogue and at home. Provide resources for parents and caregivers, such as books, CDs, and family activities, to help them teach their children about the traditions and rituals of Shabbat.\n\n3. Promote Shabbat as a time for rest and rejuvenation: Encourage members to view Shabbat as a day of rest and rejuvenation, rather than as a day of obligation. Remind them that Shabbat is a gift from God and should be treated with gratitude and appreciation.\n\n4. Offer Shabbat-themed cooking classes: Host cooking classes and workshops where participants can learn how to cook Shabbat-friendly meals. This can be a great way to bring people together and create a sense of community.\n\n5. Offer home-based Shabbat learning opportunities: Provide members with opportunities to learn and study Shabbat at home. This can take the form of online or in-person classes, book clubs, or discussion groups.\n\n6. Promote “Shabbat-friendly” businesses and services: Encourage members to support local businesses that are open on Shabbat, such as grocery stores, restaurants, and dry cleaners. This can help to normalize Shabbat observance in the community.\n\n7. Encourage members to make Shabbat a priority: Remind members that Shabbat should always take precedence over other activities. Encourage them to turn off their phones and computers, unplug from technology, and disconnect from work on this special day.\n\n8. Offer Shabbat hospitality: Encourage members to open their homes to others on Shabbat. This can take the form of a potluck, casual gathering, or formal Shabbat dinner. This builds community and strengthens connections between members.\n\n9. Promote Shabbat-friendly travel: Encourage members to travel to Shabbat-observant destinations, such as Israel, Orthodox Jewish communities in the United States, or Jewish heritage sites. This helps to instill a sense of Jewish identity and pride, as well as an appreciation for Shabbat as a universal Jewish practice.\n\n10. Emphasize the spirit of Shabbat, not the letter of the law: Remind members that Shabbat is about rest, reflection, and connection with family and community, not only about the rules and regulations. Focus on the spirit of the law, rather than the letter of the law, when teaching and promoting Shabbat observance.\n\nIn summary, Shabbat is a precious gift from God and a time for rest, reflection, and connection. By implementing these measures, the Sophia Jewish Center can help to foster a stronger sense of Shabbat observance in the community."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " of of ([c of [([[ne (​ of [[ [[ [( ( [([­ ( [-[ [[ (–[–(––c ([ [- of [ of of( – of of of of [c of of of (t of [c of of [of of of of [c ([c [c (c (c of [c (((c [w (m ( (t (m (t of [-N of [h ((m of (m [c (p, it (h [n-t it ([c of or of [se of of (c (d [b and,, (th, [t of (t of of [of [c of ( [sp of of (c [se [ch [c ((c of (((m ( ( ( (( ( ((ne of [tr of (b ((((com [c and (((lo (de of [c of [([ch [(p of ((( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of, of of of of of of of of (of of (of of of of of of of of of [w (: (m, – of and, – – [of of of of of of of of of ((of of of of of of of of of of, of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of more of of  of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of of – of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of ch of ( of [ and of of of of of of of of that of of of of of of ( of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of ( of ( (, (( ( of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of ( of of of of of of of of [ of of [ (h of of [, of [, [( of ( [ [ch ( [ch [h [[ [im [t [h of [lo [ [( [­ of [-h of of [ – or of or of of of ( –, n, (, and, and of of of of of it of of (.
