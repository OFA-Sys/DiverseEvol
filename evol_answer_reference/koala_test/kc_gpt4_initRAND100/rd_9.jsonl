{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banks use cash as a buffer for potential losses for a few reasons. Firstly, cash is considered a highly liquid asset, meaning that it can easily be converted into cash or used to meet immediate obligations. This is important for banks as they need to be able to meet their customers' withdrawal and payment requests at all times. Additionally, cash can be easily monitored, and banks can ensure that it is kept in a safe and secure location.\n\nCash is also a low-risk asset, meaning that there is a low chance of loss or depreciation. This makes it an ideal buffer for potential losses, as banks can use it to cover potential losses without having to sell other assets or raise capital from investors. \n\nLastly, cash is a readily available and relatively inexpensive way for banks to meet their capital requirements. Banks are required to have a certain amount of capital on hand to protect against potential losses, and cash can be easily used to meet this requirement.\n\nIn summary, cash is an ideal buffer for potential losses for banks because it is a highly liquid, low-risk asset that can easily be monitored and used to meet capital requirements."}

They loved to spin and jump around him, making him feel special. He was the king of the atom, and he knew it.\n\nOne day, a strange new creature arrived at the atom. It was tall and green, and it called itself the Photon. It said it was there to take the Nucleus on an adventure. The Nucleus was flattered, and he agreed to go with the Photon.\n\nAs they traveled together, the Nucleus learned many new things about the world. He saw how electrons moved in orbits around the nucleus, and how protons and neutrons were arranged in the nucleus. He even learned about the law of conservation of matter, and how matter could be neither created nor destroyed.\n\nThe Photon took the Nucleus on many journeys, to the sun and to the stars. He showed him how atoms were created in the Big Bang, and how they could be split in nuclear reactions. Over time, the Nucleus began to understand the power of nuclear physics.\n\nOne day, the Photon took the Nucleus to a laboratory on Earth. There, he met a scientist who was studying the atom. The Nucleus was shocked to learn that scientists could manipulate atoms, and change their structure.\n\nThe Nucleus was sad to learn that people could use the power of nuclear physics for evil, to create weapons of destruction. But he was also happy to know that scientists were working to harness this power for good, to provide clean energy for the world.\n\nAs the Photon and the Nucleus continued their journey, they learned more and more about the world, and about each other.

", "answer": "Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a wizard named Hildibrand Manderville lived in the magical city of Cinderstone. He was a kind and gentle soul, known for his wisdom and knowledge of the arcane arts. Hildibrand was a scholar of rare talent, and often spent many hours of the day studying his ancient books and spell scrolls.\n\nOne day, while he was deep in thought and meditating on a spell, he made a careless mistake. A powerful, unintended, and unexpected magic surged through him, and transformed him into an entirely different being.\n\nSuddenly, Hildibrand found himself standing before him in the form of an old, wrinkled, and powerful wizard. He was dressed in dark robes and his eyes glinted with a fierce, almost feral, intensity.\n\nAt first, Hildibrand was terrified by his new form, but as time passed, he began to grow used to his new powers and responsibilities. He soon discovered that he could use his magic to help others, and he became determined to use his newfound strength for good.\n\nOne day, while journeying through the forest, Hildibrand came across a young woman who had been attacked by a pack of wolves. Without hesitation, he transformed himself into a mighty warrior and drove the beasts away. The woman was grateful for his help and together, they continued on their journey.\n\nAs time passed, Hildibrand began to feel a strange connection to the young woman. He became protective of her and wanted to help her in any way he could. Eventually, the pair became friends, and Hildibrand started to dream of a life with her by his side.\n\nOne day, while they were traveling, they came across a group of bandits who were attempting to rob a traveling merchant. Hildibrand, in his new form, swiftly defeated the bandits and drove them away.\n\nThe merchant was grateful for their help and offered to reward them with gold and jewels. The young woman, however, refused the gifts, saying that their help was enough reward in itself.\n\nHildibrand was moved by her selflessness and knew that she was the woman he had been searching for all along. Together, they continued their journey, forever bound by their shared adventures and experiences.\n\nYears passed and Hildibrand and the young woman eventually settled down in a small village. There, they built a home and started a family. Hildibrand never stopped using his powers to help others and, over time, he became known as the 'Warrior of Light'.\n\nOne day, while exploring the forest, Hildibrand came across a small, injured fox. He used his magic to heal the animal and, in thanks, the fox offered to guide him to a lost treasure.\n\nHildibrand followed the fox's instructions and soon came upon a cave filled with riches beyond his wildest dreams. He was about to take some of the treasure when he felt a strange pull towards the last, unopened chest.\n\nAs he opened the chest, a powerful, golden ring fell into his hand. Immediately, he knew that this was the ring he had been searching for. It was the same ring that had transformed him into the powerful wizard he had become.\n\nWith a final wave of gratitude, Hildibrand returned to his normal form and, with the help of the Warrior of Light and Nashu, he used the ring to restore his gentle, scholarly self.\n\nAs time passed, Hildibrand and the young woman lived happily ever after in the small village, with their children and grandchildren by their side. Hildibrand never forgot the lessons he had learned during his journey and, from that day on, he used his powers for good, always striving to become a better and more noble person."}

Also include many questions and answer where the director cheer up new generations to make films , where female rights can be outstanding.", "answer": "Interview with a Female Film director\n\nJournalist: Hello, Director, welcome to our interview. It’s great to have you here.\n\nDirector: Thank you, it’s great to be here.\n\nJournalist: So, tell me, why do you think there are so few female film directors in the world?\n\nDirector: Well, I think there are many reasons for it. Firstly, women face a lot of discrimination in the film industry, both in front of and behind the camera. Many people still think that women are not capable of directing films, and they prefer to work with male directors instead. There is also a lot of gender stereotyping in the film industry, where women are often typecast into certain roles or stories, while men can be given more varied and complex characters to play.\n\nIn addition, there is a lack of female role models in the industry, which makes it harder for women to enter and succeed in the field. Many women don’t feel like they have the necessary support or resources to pursue their dream of directing, while men often have a lot of help and encouragement from their friends, family and mentors.\n\nAll these factors combined make it difficult for women to break into the industry and to be taken seriously as directors. Hopefully, though, things are beginning to change, and we are seeing more and more women becoming directors. It’s important for women to support each other and to continue to fight for equality in the film industry.\n\nJournalist: So, what can be done to increase the number of female film directors in the world?\n\nDirector: There are several things that can be done. Firstly, it is important to promote and support female directors, by providing opportunities for them to make films and by giving their work the attention and recognition it deserves. Many women have had their careers stalled or derailed by sexual harassment and abuse in the industry, so it’s important to create safe and inclusive spaces for women to work.\n\nIt’s also essential to address the gender pay gap in the film industry, so that women receive equal pay for equal work. And, of course, it’s vital to continue to fight for gender equality and to speak out against discrimination and sexism. Women need to feel empowered to pursue their dreams and to believe in themselves, no matter what obstacles they face.\n\nJournalist: Thank you for your insightful answers, Director. It was a pleasure talking to you.\n\nDirector: Thank you for having me.\n\nInterview concluded."}

This energy is measured in kilocalories (kcal), which is equivalent to 1,000 calories, and is commonly used to indicate the energy content of food.\n\nThe reason why only proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are considered to have caloric value is because these three macronutrients provide the body with energy through the process of metabolism. Protein and carbohydrates are broken down during digestion to release their respective building blocks - amino acids and glucose - which are then used by the body for numerous functions, including energy production. Fats are also broken down during digestion, but they provide the body with more energy than carbohydrates and protein, as they contain more than twice the number of calories per gram.\n\nOn the other hand, vitamins, minerals, and other electrolytes do not provide the body with energy, but are still essential for normal metabolic function and various other bodily processes. Therefore, their caloric value is usually considered to be 0 kcal per gram."}

Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness.

This project aims to improve water safety by implementing a flood warning system for a local river.\n\nThe first step in this project is to conduct a detailed flood study to understand the nature and frequency of floods in the river. This analysis will involve collecting and analyzing data such as the river's historical flood records, rainfall patterns, and topography of the surrounding area. Based on the findings of the flood study, the next step will be to identify the areas in the river basin that are most vulnerable to flooding.\n\nOnce the flood-prone areas have been identified, the next step will be to develop a flood warning system that will provide advance notice to people living and working in those areas. This warning system can take many forms, such as sirens, text messages, or automated phone calls, notifying people of the impending flood and advising them to take precautions.\n\nThe final step of the project will be to implement the flood warning system. This involves setting up the warning system in the flood-prone areas, training people on how to use it, and testing the system to ensure that it is working properly.\n\nThis water safety engineering project aims to improve the safety of people living and working in the river basin by providing them with advanced warning of floods, allowing them to take appropriate measures to protect themselves and their property. It also shows how civil engineers apply their knowledge and skills to address real-world problems and improve the quality of life for the communities they serve."}

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "In instance segmentation, the accuracy rate (AP) is commonly measured using the intersection-over-union (IoU) metric, which evaluates the performance of the model by comparing the predicted mask to the ground truth mask. However, IoU alone does not capture all the details of the instance segmentation task, and there is a possibility that the model may miss some instances or make incorrect predictions.\n\nOne way to improve the AP metrics in instance segmentation is by incorporating human knowledge or external data. For example, you can use bounding boxes or masks generated by a person or an image labeling tool to train or fine-tune your instance segmentation model. This can improve the model's ability to detect and segment instances that may have been missed or misclassified by the model alone.\n\nAnother way to improve the AP metrics is by using post-processing techniques. These include background mask generation, instance cropping, and non-maximum suppression. These techniques can be used to remove incorrectly predicted or invalid instances from the final result, improving the overall accuracy of the model.\n\nIn summary, by incorporating human knowledge, using external data, and applying post-processing techniques, you can improve the accuracy of instance segmentation models and achieve higher AP metrics."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " �(c https and in ����­# e c new �(t �# ��{t in,� �� ­ of � �[ � (ch am to to to to to to to to to d � of  of of of of of of of of [(# and (-c (([st, ​ of ([ �. � ( � � �, � ﬁ � � ​ [( ( [[\t[th �(��[in in in in, [t d �# [to, ­, �((< (# (([ � � (( �[[ [ex [[[[|[[[in [[[[[[[� ﬁ [that [al and st [ho un ­ �` ¨ ¨ t and [h, �[[[[([­(h, �,�[�[­[�� � of of of of of of (­. my either\n (-b, ��( �​, ��� � [[of of of of of of of of of of [co.\n [n, in, d of, of, of of of of, of of of of of of of of of st and {­ in our. � ​ � h � ​  as​ of [​[�[�( � of of of of of of of of of [of of �"}

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related concepts, as ideological thinking often leads to inconsistent beliefs and behaviors. Simply put, ideology is a system of beliefs that provides a comprehensive and coherent worldview or set of principles on which an individual or group bases their beliefs and actions. As a result, individuals with an ideological mindset can often be very committed to their beliefs and are willing to defend them even when confronted with evidence or logical reasoning that challenges them. This can lead to inconsistency, as individuals will often pick and choose which parts of their ideology to support or reject based on their own personal beliefs or the situation at hand. For instance, an individual who is pro-choice may support abortion in most cases, but not in others if it conflicts with their personal beliefs. This type of thinking is often driven by emotions, intuition, or personal bias, rather than objective reasoning. Overall, inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related concepts that can often go hand-in-hand, as individuals with strong ideological beliefs are more likely to engage in inconsistent thinking."}

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems.

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "   code entive \n 20ical topic andificic topic offtic code phrase, 1 urnific theucificive theificive ictive [Theicate planical logicical  the  the      "}

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

However, I have attempted to make it as unique and interesting as possible.\n\nLong ago, in a forgotten land, there was a once-proud elven kingdom. The elves were a race of powerful mages, skilled warriors, and nature-loving people. However, their kingdom was threatened by a dark sorcerer who had been plotting their downfall for a long time. The sorcerer lured the elven king and his army into a trap, and they were all slain. \n\nThe survivors of the war were scattered throughout the land, and the elven kingdom was left in ruins. Among those who fled was a young half-elf woman named Isarel. She had been born to an elven mother and a human father, and had been cast out of her elven kin for her mixed blood.\n\nIsarel was a skilled ranger, and she knew that she could not simply stay in one place, as the sorcerer's henchmen would soon find her. So, she set out on a journey to find a new home for her people. Along the way, she met a human warrior named Kael. They formed a bond, and together they wandered the land, searching for a place where they could build a new elven settlement.\n\nThey finally found a secluded forest, and decided to make it their home. However, it was not an easy task to make the land habitable. They had to clear the forest, build houses, and cultivate the land. Eventually, their hard work paid off, and they were able to establish a thriving elven community.\n\nRaven is the descendant of Isarel and Kael. She was born and raised in the elven settlement, and from a young age, she showed a natural talent for hunting and tracking. She grew up learning about nature and the ways of the elven people.\n\nAs she got older, Raven began to feel a strong connection to the forest, and she often went on long journeys alone, communing with the spirits of the land. One day, while she was in the forest, she had a vision of a great evil threatening the elven settlement. She returned home to warn the others, but no one believed her. They thought she was just being overly dramatic and imagining things.\n\nRaven was heartbroken by their rejection, and she left the settlement, never to return. She wandered the land, searching for answers, but all she found were more questions. Eventually, she gave up on trying to convince the elves of the danger that was coming, and she set out on her own, determined to protect the land and its inhabitants, no matter what."}

In the app there are also 3D clothes that can be 'tried on' by the avatar, and the avatar can also do different poses. Suitable outfits are recommended based on the measurements of the avatar (e.g. height, length of limbs). Similar items from different fashion brands are suggested to the user based on their previous choice of fashion items.", "answer": "The process involves the use of several technologies including:\n- Computer Vision: This is the process of analyzing images and videos to extract useful information. In this case, the system uses computer vision techniques to analyze the video of the user and extract their measurements and other features.\n- 3D Modeling: The system reconstructs a 3D model of the user based on the measurements extracted from the video. This is achieved using advanced 3D modeling techniques.\n- Deep Learning: Deep learning techniques are used to train the system to recognize and predict what the user is going to do next in the video. This helps the system to generate realistic animations of the avatar.\n- Augmented Reality: The system uses augmented reality techniques to display the 3D avatar in the real-world environment, making it look as if the user is wearing the clothes in the video.\n- Machine Learning: Machine learning techniques are used to train the system to recommend fashion items to the user based on their measurements and history of previous choices.\n\nThe technologies involved in this process are:\n- Computer Vision\n- 3D Modeling\n- Deep Learning\n- Augmented Reality\n- Machine Learning\n\nKeywords related to the technologies used in this process include:\n- Computer Vision\n- 3D Modeling\n- Deep Learning\n- Augmented Reality\n- Machine Learning"}
{"id": "koala_63", "prompt": "Is online casino legal in India?", "answer": "Online casino is not legal in India as per the current laws. The Indian government has not legalized online gambling and casinos, nor has it issued licenses for online gambling operations. However, there is a provision for states to allow online gambling within their jurisdiction, so it's possible that some states may choose to legalize it in the future. In the meantime, it's best to avoid online casinos that operate in India or accept Indian players."}

Growing up, my father would take me on trips to museums and art galleries, where I'd be awestruck by the beauty and power of the images I saw. I was particularly drawn to the works of Ansel Adams, whose stunning landscapes made me want to explore the world outside my own backyard. I remember poring over his books, studying his composition and lighting techniques, and trying to replicate his images with my own camera.\n\nAs I grew older, I continued to be captivated by the art of photography, and I spent much of my time experimenting with different styles and techniques. I was especially drawn to portraiture, and I would often spend hours in front of the camera, posing for friends and family. I loved the way a photograph could capture a person's unique essence, and I became fascinated by the way light could transform a subject's features.\n\nOver time, my photography evolved from a hobby into a true passion. I began to pursue it professionally, and I was lucky enough to have my work published in magazines and online publications. I still feel a thrill every time I see one of my images in print, and it continues to motivate me to create more inspiring images.\n\nPhotography has taught me that there are endless possibilities for creativity, and that the camera can be used to capture not only the world as it appears, but also as it feels. It has allowed me to explore my emotions and my imagination, and to share my vision with others. Above all, photography has inspired me to see the world in a new light, to appreciate the beauty that exists in the everyday, and to find joy in the small moments."}

What sort of experience and post-graduate education path would you recommend? Please provide non-obvious and atypical career paths leading to such positions, on top of the classic ones.", "answer": "To become a plant/manufacturing/production manager, you need to start at the bottom, working as an entry-level operator, and then move up through the ranks as you gain experience and demonstrate your leadership potential. You should aim to acquire relevant knowledge and skills through formal training programs, on-the-job training, and continuing education.\n\nFor post-graduate education, you can pursue an MBA, ideally with a focus on operations or supply chain management. You can also consider getting a master's degree in engineering, with a concentration in industrial engineering. These programs can help you develop the analytical, problem-solving, and decision-making skills that are essential for a plant/manufacturing/production manager.\n\nAs you gain experience and prove your ability to lead a team, you can move up to a supervisory position, and then to managerial roles. From there, you can move into a more corporate role, serving as a divisional or regional manager, overseeing multiple plants or factories.\n\nAs you gain more leadership experience, you can consider taking on more strategic responsibilities, such as developing and implementing plant-level and corporate-level operational plans, and identifying and implementing cost-saving and efficiency-improving initiatives.\n\nTo become a chief operating officer, you need to have a track record of success in managing multiple plants or factories, and of successfully leading a team of managers. You also need a proven ability to develop and implement strategic plans, and to make decisions that drive growth and profitability.\n\nOne atypical career path to becoming a chief operating officer is to start your career in finance or accounting, and then move into operations, where you can demonstrate your ability to manage costs, and make smart decisions that drive bottom-line growth.\n\nIn summary, to become a plant/manufacturing/production manager and eventually a chief operating officer, you need to start at the bottom, and work your way up through the ranks, gaining relevant knowledge and skills along the way.

{"id": "koala_66", "prompt": "explain the basics of area and perimeter", "answer": "Area and perimeter are two important concepts in geometry and trigonometry. Both are measures of the size of a two-dimensional shape, but they are calculated in different ways.\n\nArea is the total amount of space enclosed within a closed shape. It is measured in square units, such as square meters or square feet. \n\nTo find the area of a shape, you first need to determine the size of its outer perimeter, which is the distance around the edge of the shape. Then, you can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is `area = length * width`, where `l` is the length and `w` is the width.\n\nFor example, if you have a square with dimensions of 5 meters by 5 meters, its area would be calculated as `area = 5 * 5 = 25 square meters`.\n\nPerimeter is the distance around the edge of a closed shape. It is calculated by adding the lengths of all the sides of the shape.\n\nFor a square, the perimeter is equal to four times the length of a side. So, for our example square, the perimeter would be `4 * 5 = 20 meters`.\n\nIt's important to note that area and perimeter are both measures of size, but they are calculated in different ways, and they are not always proportional to each other. For example, a square with a side length of 10 meters would have the same area as a circle with a diameter of 10 meters, but the perimeter of the square would be greater than the perimeter of the circle."}

My name is Dr. Abigail and I'm a nephrologist, which means that I specialize in kidney disease.\n\nYour diabetes and CKD are closely related and often co-exist. This means that together they are placing a significant burden on your kidneys. Managing both conditions is important in order to prevent further damage to your kidneys.\n\nIt's important to note that diabetes and CKD are both chronic conditions that require lifelong treatment and monitoring. Unfortunately, there is no cure for either condition, but with proper management, they can be controlled and kept under good control to prevent further damage.\n\nYour current treatment for diabetes, which includes metformin, a sulfonylurea, and an SGLT-2 inhibitor, seems appropriate for your condition. These medications help to control your blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of developing complications associated with diabetes.\n\nIn addition to your current treatments, it's important to maintain a healthy diet and exercise routine, as these can help to control your blood sugar levels, reduce the risk of developing complications, and promote overall good health.\n\nIt's also important to monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as these can be affected by diabetes and CKD.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for CKD. Instead, the goal of treatment is to slow or prevent the progression of the disease, and to reduce the risk of developing complications.\n\nAs part of your treatment plan, your doctor may recommend that you have regular checkups and tests to monitor your kidney function. These may include blood tests to check your creatinine and protein levels, and a urine test to check for protein and blood.\n\nIn addition to monitoring your kidney function, it's important to manage any other medical conditions you may have, such as high blood pressure, and to quit smoking if you currently smoke.\n\nAs your CKD progresses, you may need to make changes to your treatment plan. If your kidney function continues to decline, you may need to start dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\nIt's important to discuss your treatment options with your doctor and to work together to develop a treatment plan that's right for you.\n\nAs for your question about insulin, this is a decision that should be made between you and your doctor. In some cases, insulin may be recommended for people with CKD, especially if their blood sugar levels are not well controlled with other medications. In general, insulin is generally not recommended for people with CKD who have no symptoms of diabetes, as it can increase the risk of developing complications.\n\nUltimately, the decision to start insulin should be based on your individual needs and the potential benefits and risks.

We are then better equipped to empathize with and understand others, as we understand that each of us is on our own journey of self-discovery and growth.\n\nIn this world, where social media and technology have created unrealistic standards and expectations, it is more important than ever that we remind ourselves that true beauty and value come from within. When we learn to love and accept ourselves, flaws and all, we are better able to love and accept others, creating a more harmonious society."}

{"id": "koala_80", "prompt": "Why does warmth make you feel tired?", "answer": "Warmth can make you feel tired for a variety of reasons. First, when the body is exposed to warm temperatures, the internal thermostat tries to maintain a constant body temperature by increasing heat production and releasing sweat. This process can take a lot of energy, leading to fatigue. In addition, warm temperatures can also slow down certain bodily functions, such as the heart rate and metabolism, which can also make you feel tired. When you are tired, it can be harder to stay alert and focused, which can make you lose your balance or make mistakes, potentially leading to accidents or injuries. Overall, warmth can make you feel tired because it can impact your physical and mental energy levels, making it harder to stay alert, focused, and active."}

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a computational method used to solve engineering problems involving the analysis of structures and physical systems. It is a form of finite element analysis (FEA), in which the problem is divided into smaller parts called elements, which are assembled into a larger model known as a mesh. Each element can be analyzed separately, which makes the method efficient and scalable.\n\nThe FEM is based on the assumption that the behavior of a physical system can be modeled by a collection of smaller elements that capture the important characteristics of the system. These elements may represent smaller components within a larger structure, such as beams, plates, or shells. The behavior of the system is then determined by analyzing the response of the elements, rather than the entire structure.\n\nOne of the advantages of the FEM is its ability to account for complex loading conditions and geometric changes. It can be used to analyze problems involving stress, heat transfer, fluid flow, and other phenomena that can be modeled with partial differential equations. The method is commonly used in the design and analysis of engineering products and structures, and is often used in conjunction with computer-aided design (CAD) to optimize designs and ensure that they meet regulatory requirements.\n\nIn summary, the Finite Element Method is a powerful computational tool that allows engineers to analyze complex physical systems by dividing them into smaller elements and analyzing the behavior of these elements individually. It is especially suited to problems involving stress, heat transfer, and fluid flow, and is widely used in the design and analysis of engineering products and structures."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " [[co (sen, [(p, (gener, [[h, [(m [dis (subject, (h (ch (h, (con (per (of [of of the of [of of of [of of [[of of [(N (con of [sub of  of (ch of [[f [t [gener [con (c ((sa (sa (h (sen (supp [sub [h [c ([character ([of [specific (([h [mark [[[[[[[subject, [[[[t, (d, (power (h, (I [(p (cou, (inf, and, (specific, [of [of, of, of [of of, of, (of, ho, of the [of of of of (of, [h, (b, inn, (ink, [d, [h (c, [inf, [(p ((dis of (of of of (of (of of [of of  of  of of [of of [of (of [of of [d of [[(sub of [int of [[c [or [[of [[h [h [[inf of [(c (h of ink of [l,-d (C (for (C (dis ([H [C (F (of [of ((d [h ([(reg of of (int of (([[(B of the ([C of (P ((per [([[([(c ((inf ((h, (w ([comment ([([of (–(in (((b [(or ([([[[([sur [of the [(tr, [ (In [[ - ([(* ((subject (tr ([(f (sur (of (· (and ([p, (((cont ((h of [d (j (of (h (C (h (or ([specific (specific ([s (f ([b [c, ((C of (of -·, (d (po (dis (subject (c ([([([(t ((d (sa ((h ([t (dis, [of (of of (of of of [of of (h of w of (of, ((d (comment (d (j, (t, (c ((sa (cont (sp, (de, of, (and [(h of (c of ((my (((h of of, (for of (h (t (h [trans ((h (pop (of (c of of (mar (p em (or and [for [[h of (([of, of [of of of [of (of of (c (cont of [sp (c �([of (p of ([of of of,, (de, (t, (trans -(or [((t [and [b (of of of (of (of of ne, (dis, �[of of of (of of the of of (about of about of of about of about of ([h (d, (po (j (or, (b, of, ñ (liter, l, (lo, ((co, (of [[of ([[of, of (of of, of (of of ([of,,, (of in (((sp, of,  of, (l, - of,, of, ([-,, [[(t (  (f (c ((or, (or, ((of, of, (of, of ((of of, of of, of of of, ([(b (d, (de ( (, pr, (d, (t, (st ro (of ([(of ( of of, of of of of (of of (C of of of of of of of of of of ( of [(  of (?

This is where the majority of the hop flavor and aroma is extracted from the hops, and the alpha acids present in the hops react with the warm water to produce bittering and flavor compounds. The length of time that the hops are boiled can have a significant impact on the flavor and aroma of the beer. Hops are typically added in the last 15-20 minutes of the boil to maximize the extraction of hop flavor and aroma, while minimizing the bitterness.

{"id": "koala_95", "prompt": "ideas for building a waitlist for a new product or service", "answer": "1. Create a website or landing page specifically for the waitlist: This page should include information about the product or service, as well as a form for people to sign up. Make sure the page is easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing, as this will encourage people to sign up.\n\n2. Use social media to promote the waitlist: Post about the waitlist on all of your social media channels, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Make sure to include a link to the waitlist page, so people can easily sign up.\n\n3. Offer incentives for signing up early: Offer early-bird discounts, free shipping, or bonus content to people who sign up for the waitlist early. This will encourage people to sign up right away, and it will also build excitement and anticipation for the product or service.\n\n4. Offer exclusive updates and sneak peeks: Keep the people on the waitlist informed and engaged by sending them regular updates about the product or service. Include behind-the-scenes information, early access to new features, and sneak peeks of upcoming releases. This will help to build anticipation and excitement, and it will also demonstrate that you value your customers' feedback and input.\n\n5. Keep the waitlist manageable: Don't allow too many people to sign up for the waitlist, as this can lead to delays and confusion when it comes time to announce the launch date. Instead, set a specific number of spots on the waitlist, and only admit new people when openings become available. This will help to prevent overwhelm and keep the waitlist manageable.\n\n6. Announce the launch date early to those on the waitlist: Once you have a firm launch date for your product or service, let people on the waitlist know as soon as possible. This will help to build excitement and anticipation, and it will also reduce the chances of people forgetting or losing interest before the launch.\n\nOverall, the most important thing to keep in mind when building a waitlist for a new product or service is to be transparent and communicative with your customers. Let them know what to expect, and keep them informed and engaged throughout the process. This will help to build trust and goodwill with your customers, and it will also increase the likelihood of a successful launch."}
{"id": "koala_96", "prompt": "assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual", "answer": "As a therapist, I would first like to commend you for recognizing that your emotional reactivity can be problematic in your relationships. Many people struggle with this, and it is important to take steps towards addressing it. \n\nOne way to reduce your emotional reactivity is by practicing a \"pause ritual.\" This is a technique where you stop and take a deep breath before responding to a situation or comment. This gives you an opportunity to take a step back, think about what you want to say, and respond in a more thoughtful and considered way.\n\nThe first step in using a pause ritual is to become aware of your tendency to react quickly and impulsively. Notice when you feel yourself becoming defensive, angry, or upset, and take a moment to pause and breathe. You can do this by simply taking a few deep breaths or counting to ten in your head. This will help you to calm down and get some space from the situation.\n\nOnce you have paused, think about what you want to say or do in response. Is there a constructive way to respond to the situation? Would a more positive or calm approach be more effective? By taking a few moments to think, you can come up with a more appropriate response, rather than reacting impulsively.\n\nFinally, once you have decided on a response, you can go ahead and say it out loud. Speak calmly and clearly, and try to keep your emotions in check. By using a pause ritual, you can take control of your emotions and respond in a more positive and productive way."}

One method involves creating a concept, then prototyping it using Godot's built-in editor. Once the core mechanics are in place, the game can be separated into independent components, which can then be refined and optimized. A more traditional approach would be to create an extensive design document, then use this as a blueprint to develop the game. This approach may involve creating a more detailed prototype using a tool like Unity or Unreal Engine, before porting it over to Godot.\n\nIt's also possible to use a combination of these methods, or to develop a custom workflow that works for you. Ultimately, the choice is up to the developer, as long as the game is developed in a way that works for them and their team."}

Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

Churned, using AI and predictive models, helps customer success teams prevent churn and get more value out of their customers. Ocean, on the other hand, is an ecommerce company that uses AI to personalize the online shopping experience.\n\nOne potential idea could be to develop a predictive model that uses shopping behavior data to predict churn in ecommerce customers. This model could predict the likelihood of a customer to churn based on their online shopping behavior. Churned's predictive models could be used to train the model, and the model's predictions could be integrated with Ocean's customer success team to identify and prevent churn in high-risk customers.\n\nAnother idea could be to develop a personalized recommendation engine that combines both shopping behavior data and customer success data. This engine could use machine learning techniques to recommend products, based on customer interests, past purchases, and churn risk. This could help Ocean increase customer engagement and retention by providing personalized recommendations that are tailored to each customer's preferences."}

How many years will the eclipse last?", "answer": "The sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is approximately 1059 kilometers. The formula for finding the distance between the Sun and Earth is:\n\nDistance between the Sun and Earth (in kilometers) = Average distance of the Earth from the Sun (in astronomical units) * 1.49597 * 10^8\n\nwhere Average distance of the Earth from the Sun (in astronomical units) is around 149,597,870 kilometers.\n\nSo, using the formula, the distance between the Sun and Earth during a solar eclipse is approximately 1059 kilometers.\n\nThe duration of a solar eclipse depends on several factors such as the location of the eclipse, the distance of the Moon and Earth from the Sun, and the shape of the Earth's shadow cast by the Moon. However, the average duration of a solar eclipse is around 7 minutes and 31 seconds. Thus, assuming that the solar eclipse lasts for an average duration, the eclipse will last for approximately 7 minutes and 31 seconds.\n\nIn conclusion, the sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometers, and the eclipse will last for approximately 7 minutes and 31 seconds."}

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "Jiddu Krishnamurti was a philosopher and spiritual teacher who, in his teachings, emphasized the importance of self-knowledge and the need for a radical change in the way we live. His approach to education was based on the premise that true learning occurs when one is able to question and challenge the prevailing assumptions and beliefs, in order to understand the world and one’s place in it more deeply.\n\nIn aikido, as in any martial art, students are taught to respond to an aggressive or threatening situation with calmness and clarity. This can be achieved through training that emphasizes physical and mental discipline, and the development of self-control and awareness. Krishnamurti believed that true self-control and awareness arise from the cultivation of compassion, whereby one develops the ability to empathize with the suffering of others and to respond with love and kindness, rather than violence.\n\nIn aikido, as in any martial art, students are also taught to respect their opponent and to respond to their attack with non-aggression and compassion. Krishnamurti believed that true non-violence arises from the understanding that the source of all violence is ignorance, fear, and the desire for power. He taught that by overcoming our own fear and aggression, we can cultivate a mindset of peace and love, which in turn can transform the world.\n\nIn summary, I believe that the principles of aikido and the teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti are deeply compatible, and that they could be integrated in aikido instruction in a way that would transform both the practice and the students."}

{"id": "koala_135", "prompt": "i assume you are familiar with the Drake equation. Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds.", "answer": "Sure! Here are the estimates and error margins for each of the Drake equation's parameters, along with the result including error bounds:\n\nN - the number of planets in the system that could potentially support life - It's difficult to estimate the number of planets in a star system that could support life, as this depends on various factors such as the planet's size, composition, and location in the system. However, a recent study by the NASA Exoplanet Archive suggests that there could be approximately 10 billion planets in our Milky Way galaxy that meet the requirements for potentially supporting life.\n\nR* - the average rate of star formation in our galaxy - This parameter is also difficult to estimate, as it depends on various factors such as the distribution of stars in our galaxy, their ages, and the duration of star formation activity. However, recent studies suggest that the average rate of star formation in our galaxy is approximately 7– 10 solar masses per year.\n\nfp - the fraction of these planets that actually develop life - This parameter also depends on various factors such as the conditions on the planet, including temperature, atmosphere, and chemical composition. However, some studies suggest that this fraction could be as high as 50%, while others suggest a lower value of around 1%.\n\nne - the average number of planets per star that actually develop life - As with the previous parameter, this one also depends on various factors such as the distribution of planets in the system, their size, and their distance from the star. However, recent studies suggest that the average number of planets per star that develop life is around 1.6.\n\nfl - the fraction of life-bearing planets that actually develop intelligent life - This parameter also depends on various factors such as the conditions on the planet, including the development of technology, culture, and society. However, some studies suggest that this value could be as high as 50%, while others suggest a lower value of around 1%.\n\nfi - the average length of time a civilization remains technologically advanced - This parameter also depends on various factors such as the development of technology, culture, and society on the planet. However, some studies suggest that this value could be as high as 20,000 years, while others suggest a lower value of around 1,000 years.\n\nfc - the average number of civilizations in our galaxy that develop technology capable of sending out communications - This parameter also depends on various factors such as the distribution of civilizations in the galaxy, their rate of technological development, and the duration of their technological advancement. However, some studies suggest that this value could be as high as 10,000, while others suggest a lower value of around 1,000.\n\nL - the average length of time these civilizations send out these communications - This parameter also depends on various factors such as the distribution of civilizations in the galaxy, their rate of technological development, and the duration of their technological advancement. However, some studies suggest that this value could be as high as 1,000 years, while others suggest a lower value of around 1.\n\nTherefore, based on the estimates and error margins provided above, the result of the Drake Equation, including the error bounds, would be:\n\nN * R * fp * ne * fl * fi * L * \n\n= 10 billion * 7-10 * 0.5 * 1.6 * 0.1 * 10,000 * 1,000 * 1,000\n\n= 450 billion - 1.2 trillion"}

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you [Music]<br>", "answer": "Kerwin Rae's video, \"Don't Chase Money, Chase Your Purpose: The Money Will Follow,\" speaks to the importance of finding one's passion and pursuing it, rather than focusing on the financial rewards that may or may not come as a result.

He also shares that it is important to develop a healthy relationship with failure, as it is a necessary part of the process of achieving success.

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double pane window can be more energy efficient than a triple pane window, but only if the additional pane of glass in the triple pane window does not contribute to reducing the window's energy efficiency. The reason for this is that the additional pane of glass added to the triple pane window increases the overall thickness of the window, which can create a thermal barrier that inhibits heat transfer.\n\nOn the other hand, a single pane window can be more energy efficient than a double pane window if it is well-maintained and has an adequate amount of insulation between the glass panes. If the window is well-maintained and the space between the glass panes is filled with a low-conductivity gas or a vacuum, the single pane window can achieve similar levels of energy efficiency as a double or triple pane window.\n\nIn summary, the energy efficiency of a window is determined by several factors, including the number of panes of glass, the thickness of each pane of glass, the quality of the glass, the type of gas or vacuum between the glass panes, and the quality of the window's installation. A double pane window can be more energy efficient than a triple pane window, but only if the additional pane of glass in the triple pane window does not affect its energy efficiency. A single pane window can be more energy efficient than a double pane window if it is well-maintained and has an adequate amount of insulation between the glass panes."}

Firstly, Kahane and his followers viewed the American Jewish Establishment as a force that oppressed and exploited the Jewish community, and they believed that violence was necessary to combat this oppression. In a similar way, Fanon and Zizek argued that the Jewish community had internalized the values and ideologies of the dominant white society, and that violence was necessary to free the community from this oppression.\n\nSecondly, Kahane and his followers believed that the American Jewish Establishment should be confronted on an ethical level, and that violence was necessary to expose the hypocrisy and inconsistency of their actions. Similarly, Fanon and Zizek argued that the Jewish establishment should be held accountable for its complicity in the oppression of the Jewish people, and that violence was necessary to challenge their authority.\n\nFinally, Kahane and his followers viewed violence as a moral imperative, believing that it was necessary to combat injustice and oppression. Fanon and Zizek also viewed violence as a moral imperative, arguing that it was necessary to disrupt the normalizing and legitimizing of oppression.\n\nIn summary, Kahane's ethics of violence echoes that of Fanon and Zizek in their discussion of the American Jewish Establishment in that they both viewed violence as a necessary and ethical means of confronting oppression and injustice."}

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type checking and class-based object-oriented programming (OOP) features. It is a cross-platform and open-source language developed by Microsoft and is compatible with ECMAScript Version 6.\n\nDuck Typing is a dynamic programming paradigm where the type of an object is determined by its behavior, rather than by its declaration. It is often described as \"if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.\" Duck Typing is sometimes used as a way to avoid the rigidity and constraints of static typing.\n\nIn TypeScript, the type system provides a level of safety and security by ensuring that code is written correctly and that data is used correctly. This helps avoid runtime errors and prevents unexpected behavior. However, TypeScript also supports Duck Typing, allowing programmers to write code in a more dynamic way and focus on the behavior of their code instead of the exact type of data. This provides flexibility and allows for easier refactoring and code maintenance.\n\nIn summary, TypeScript is a typed language that supports Duck Typing, while Duck Typing is a dynamic programming paradigm that is sometimes used in combination with TypeScript."}

By identifying the triggers that lead to problem behavior, and then creating a plan to interrupt the behavior and replace it with a more positive response, the team can help students develop more positive habits and improve their overall well-being.\n\nOverall, the insights from the book Upstream and the application to the job description of the Social Workers at Visalia Unified School District can help them to more effectively address the underlying causes of the issues faced by students, their families, and the school community, and to promote positive behavior change and academic success."}
{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are strong and lightweight materials that are used in a variety of industries, including aerospace, automotive, and construction. In buildings, carbon fibers are used for strengthening and reinforcing concrete, making structures stronger and more durable. \n\nOne application of carbon fibers in buildings is as rebar. Rebar is steel reinforcement bar that is typically used in concrete to provide strength and support. Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) can be used as an alternative to steel rebar, as they are lighter and stronger. CFRP rebar can be used in concrete to improve its overall strength, while also reducing the weight of the structure.\n\nAnother application of carbon fibers in buildings is as a material for creating composite structures. Composite structures are made up of two or more materials that are bonded together to create a new material with improved properties. In buildings, carbon fibers are combined with a resin to create a strong, durable material that can be used for creating beams, floors, and other structural components.\n\nAdditionally, carbon fibers can be used to make prefabricated buildings, where the entire structure is built in a factory and then transported to the construction site for assembly. These structures can be lighter and stronger than traditional buildings, due to the use of carbon fiber reinforcement."}

Lack of infrastructure: Farmers in Africa often lack access to basic infrastructure, such as roads, storage facilities, and irrigation systems, which affects their ability to produce food and boost agricultural productivity.\n\n3. Limited access to finance: Many smallholder farmers in Africa do not have access to credit or other forms of finance, which limits their ability to invest in agricultural technologies, equipment, and infrastructure.\n\n4. Inadequate agricultural research and development: There is a significant need for more investment in agricultural research and development, particularly in Africa, in order to develop new crops, crop varieties, and farming techniques that are suitable for local conditions.\n\n5. Climate change: Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on African agriculture, including more frequent droughts and floods, changes in rainfall patterns, and rising temperatures, all of which will pose challenges for farmers.\n\n6. Increasing competition from imported food: The increasing availability of inexpensive imported food, particularly from China, has put pressure on African farmers, making it harder for them to compete in local markets.\n\n7. Post-harvest losses: High levels of post-harvest losses due to poor storage, processing, and transportation infrastructure result in significant food waste and reduced income for farmers.\n\n8. High levels of poverty and hunger: Despite improvements in agricultural productivity, the number of hungry people in Africa continues to rise, due to the interplay of several factors, including limited access to land, finance, and education, as well as the effects of climate change and conflicts.\n\n9. Lack of cooperation among African countries: There is a lack of cooperation and coordination among African countries in the areas of agricultural research and development, trade, and other areas that could benefit from greater regional integration.\n\n10. Lack of commitment from governments: Many African governments have failed to prioritize the agricultural sector, and have not invested adequately in agricultural research, extension services, and other support for farmers."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is one of the most significant and urgent challenges facing the world today. It is a long-term, global issue that threatens the environmental, economic, and social stability of our planet. In the coming years, its impacts are expected to become increasingly severe, with potentially devastating consequences for human health, food security, water supply, and the global economy.\n\nThe main cause of climate change is the increased levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, primarily due to human activities such as the use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. These gases trap heat and warm the planet, leading to temperature increases, sea level rise, and more extreme weather events. If left unchecked, climate change will continue to worsen, leading to more severe droughts, floods, and storms, as well as the degradation of ecosystems, biodiversity loss, and increased migration.\n\nThe good news is that there are things we can do to combat climate change and mitigate its impacts. The key is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to cleaner, renewable sources of energy. This can be achieved through greater investment in sustainable technologies, energy efficiency improvements, and the development of low-carbon transportation systems.\n\nIn addition, we must reduce our consumption of resources and move towards more sustainable lifestyles. This can be achieved through the adoption of more environmentally friendly practices, such as recycling, reducing food waste, and using public transportation.\n\nFinally, it is important to raise awareness of the threat of climate change and to promote action at all levels - from individuals to governments to businesses. By working together, we can take steps to minimize the damage caused by climate change, and to build a more sustainable future for all."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "When watching television, the viewing experience is broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks, which makes it feel less overwhelming and more attainable than watching a full-length film. Additionally, most TV shows are designed to be binge-watched, with cliffhangers at the end of each episode that encourage viewers to continue watching. This format creates a sense of urgency and anticipation that keeps viewers engaged and makes it easier to devote more time to the show. Lastly, TV shows tend to have recurring characters and storylines that build upon each other over time, which allows viewers to develop a deeper connection with the story and the characters. In summary, the difference in effort comes down to the way TV shows are designed to be consumed, in smaller chunks and with an element of anticipation, compared to films which are more likely to be watched in one sitting."}

{"id": "koala_164", "prompt": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?", "answer": "The wavelength of light emitted by metals varies depending on their temperature. As the temperature of a metal increases, the electrons within its atoms begin to move more quickly, causing the metal to become more energetic. This increased energy causes the metal to release photons, which are packets of light. The wavelength of these photons is determined by the energy of the photon, which in turn is determined by the temperature of the metal.\n\nAt room temperature, most metals emit photons with wavelengths in the visible light range, between 400 and 700 nanometers (nm). However, as the temperature of the metal increases, the wavelength of the emitted light becomes shorter. For example, at 500°C, gold emits photons with a wavelength of around 570nm, while at 800°C, silver emits photons with a wavelength of around 400nm.\n\nIn summary, the wavelength of light emitted by a metal increases as its temperature increases, with the wavelength becoming shorter at higher temperatures."}
{"id": "koala_165", "prompt": "Pretend for argumentsake you are lawyer defending putin cite your case", "answer": "As the lawyer defending Vladimir Putin in this imaginary scenario, I would raise several legal arguments in his favor.\n\nFirst, Putin is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and the prosecution must provide sufficient evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. At this point, there is no conclusive evidence linking Putin to the alleged crimes.\n\nSecond, as the head of state, Putin enjoys immunity from prosecution while in office. Under international law, heads of state enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution while in office, and only if they relinquish their office can they be tried for their actions. Since Putin is still in office, he cannot be prosecuted for any alleged crimes.\n\nThird, even if Putin were to be found guilty of the crimes, he would only face punishment under Russian law, and not international law. As the head of state of a sovereign nation, Putin is responsible for upholding the laws of his country, and if found guilty, he would face punishment according to the laws of Russia. However, international law does not allow for the extradition or prosecution of foreign leaders for actions taken while in office, unless the actions amount to genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the allegations against Putin are serious and troubling, there is currently insufficient evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As long as he remains in office, he cannot be prosecuted under international law, and even if he were to be found guilty, he would only face punishment under Russian law."}

He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.<br>He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old <br>car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month.<br>Furthermore this percent of loss increases of `0.5` percent <br>Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.<br>Can you help him?<br>How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, <br>and how much money will he have left over?", "answer": "It is not possible to accurately predict the future, and so I cannot help him with his calculations. However, I can provide him with some general guidelines that may be helpful.\n\nFirstly, assuming that his car costs $2000 and the secondhand car costs $8000, the difference between the two prices is $6000. The man can save $1000 each month by cutting back on his expenses, or by earning more income. If we assume that he cuts back on his expenses, it will take him approximately 6 months (1.5% decrease in price per month * 4 months) to save the $6000.\n\nHowever, the prices of the cars are not fixed, and they are subject to change. If the prices of the cars continue to decrease at the same rate of 1.5% per month, it will take him approximately 9 months (1.5% decrease in price per month * 6 months) to save the $6000.\n\nIf the man wants to have some leeway in case the prices of the cars continue to decrease at the same rate, he can adjust his savings goal to take into account the possibility that the savings may take longer. In this case, it may be wise to aim to save $7000 instead of $6000, in case the prices continue to decrease. This would mean that he would need to save $1050 each month instead of $1000, and it would take him approximately 11 months (1.5% decrease in price per month * 9 months) to save the $7000.\n\nIt is important to note that the percentages of decrease in price that I have used in my calculations are hypothetical and may not reflect the actual prices of the cars. Each person's situation is different, and so it is important for the man to carefully consider his own financial circumstances and make informed decisions based on his own calculations."}

{"id": "koala_176", "prompt": "7 / 7Write a detailed patent writing for an innovative and novel way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as a digital certificates,  that is non-obvious using verifiable credentials, digital wallet on a blockchain as payment provision, and machine learning. Include claims on detailed processes involved, system architecture and algorithms", "answer": "A novel way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates, using verifiable credentials, digital wallet on a blockchain as a payment provision, and machine learning, is disclosed herein. This solution is non-obvious, and provides several advantages over the traditional methods of issuing such certificates.\n\nThe system architecture involves three main components: the community tax certificate issuance system, the blockchain network, and the verification and authentication system.\n\nThe community tax certificate issuance system is responsible for managing the entire process of issuing community tax certificates, from the initial application to the final issuance. This system uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to analyze the applicant's information and ensure that all the necessary requirements are met.\n\nThe blockchain network is used to store all the data related to the issuance of the community tax certificates, including the application information, the verification process, and the issuance decision. The blockchain network provides a secure and immutable way of tracking and storing all data.\n\nThe verification and authentication system is responsible for ensuring that the applicant's information, including their identity, address, and financial status, is accurate and valid. This system uses advanced biometric authentication methods, such as face recognition, fingerprint scanning, and voice recognition, to verify the applicant's identity.\n\nThe processes involved in issuing community tax certificates in this system are as follows:\n\n1. Application submission: The applicant submits an application to the community tax certificate issuance system, either online or through a government office. This application includes the applicant's personal information, as well as details of the property or business for which the certificate is being applied.\n\n2. Verification and authentication: The verification and authentication system verifies the applicant's identity and validates the information provided in the application. If the information is accurate and the applicant is identified as the rightful owner of the property or business, the application is sent to the blockchain network for further processing.\n\n3. Blockchain network verification: The blockchain network validates the application information and ensures that all the necessary requirements have been met before the community tax certificate can be issued. If the blockchain network determines that the application is valid, the system generates a digital certificate and stores it on the blockchain.\n\n4. Certificate issuance: The community tax certificate is then issued to the applicant through an automated process, either as a digital document that can be accessed through a secure login or as a physical document that is mailed to the applicant's address.\n\nThe advantages of this system include the use of advanced technologies such as blockchain, machine learning, and biometric authentication to ensure the accuracy and security of the issuance process. The use of digital certificates as a form of payment also eliminates the need for cash or checks, reducing the risk of fraud and error. Additionally, the system provides transparency and auditability, as all the data and transactions are stored on the blockchain network, creating a permanent and immutable record of the issuance process."}
{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " [ of [ [(  ( [c ( [  ([ (  [[  ([ ( – ( [ [ ( ( – [- [ - [ - (, [ ( ( -  ( of [( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of – of [( of [h [c [l [(( ( [c [ of a [ of of – ( [, (c (( ( [ ( ( ( of ( [( of [p of (c (de ( - ( – ( - and ( - and ( ( - (  (c of ( and l of [of of of of of ( of ( – — ([, (m ( (  of (of of of of of of of of [ of [ ( [( of [ ( ( (( [( [ [ll ( ([ of  and of [ch of [c [com of ( ( of of (p of ( [( and ( and ( ( of and of of [[ [( of of of of of ( [of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of (tr of of of of of of of of of of of of (c of of  of of of of of [(of of of ( of of of of of [ of [(( [([ of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [c of of of of, of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of of ( of of ( of of of ( ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of [ of of of of of [ of of of [ of are of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of( of of of of of of of of of [ of of ( ( of of of of of ( of (, of of [ of of of of of of of, of of of of of of of of of of of  of [ of ( of of of of of [C of of of of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of ( of of of ( [ [ [ ( [ [  [ [([ [h [ [ny of [ [ [ [ ( h of of  of of of [, [ of of of of of of [. and [[( ( it of c [ of ( of of of of - of of of of ( of [ (- ( ( ( [ ( ( (( [ and [. of ( [( ( [ ( ( of and ( ( [ ( ( ( ( [ ( ( and ( [ C, ( ( [ - C [ ( ( (, of (- ( ( ( ( – ( and [( ( [ ( [ [, [ ( (( of our of ( of ( ( ( ( in (, ( ( (, ( ( ( ( ( and ( [ of ( of of of ( ( of of ( ( ( ( ( ( [[ ( ( [ [ ( ( (( (, ( ( ( ( ( ( [ [ ( ( [ ( ( [ ( [ ( ( of [ [, [, (, [k, are, ( [ of, of of of [ of of [ of of of ( ( [ [ of of ( of C of of of of of of of of of of of ( ( ( - [  ( [ [ c [ of [ [ ( ( of of of ( of [ of of of of of of ( of [ of of of of ( of ( of [ of of of of of of of of of of of [ ([ ([[ne ( ( [ [e ( or (( (, or,, of of [( - ( ( — ( ( ( ( [ [[ of ( ( of of ( of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of “ ,, (, [ - and,, C, for, (. of [ ( ( of “ ( of, [( [- of ( of of of of of ( of [ of of of [ of of of of of of of of of [( of, ( T, of ( ( of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of P, of of F, for ( of, for for for, in and, of, of of of of, of, C, C of of ( [ of of of of of of of of [ of and of of of ( of [ of [ [ of ( of [ of and of of of of of, of of of of, of [ of of of, of [( ( ( of ((( of("}

{"id": "koala_179", "prompt": "How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table?", "answer": "There are many ways to calculate the amount of variations possible on a 3x4 table. One method is to use the binomial distribution, which provides the probability of obtaining a given number of successes in n independent trials, each with a fixed probability of success p. \n\nIn our case, our table has 4 rows and 3 columns, and each cell in our table can have either a “1” or a “0” in it. Therefore, we can consider each cell to be a separate trial, and the number of successes can be either 1 or 0. \n\nUsing the binomial distribution, the probability of getting exactly r successes in n independent trials, each with probability p of success, is given by the formula:\n\np(r, n) = C(n, r) * p^r * (1 - p) ^ (n - r)\n\nWhere C(n, r) is the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose r objects from n.\n\nIn our case, the number of successes can take the values 1 or 0, so we can substitute these values into the formula to get the probability of obtaining each of these values.\n\nFor example, the probability of getting exactly 1 success in 4 independent trials, each with a probability of success of 1/3, is given by:\n\np(1, 4) = C(4, 1) * (1/3) ^ 1 * (2/3) ^ 3\n\nWhich can be rearranged to get the number of ways to get exactly 1 success, which is:\n\nC(4, 1) * (1/3) ^ 1 * (2/3) ^ 3\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\np(1, 4) = 4!/[(4-1)! * 3!] * (1/3) ^ 1 * (2/3) ^ 3\n\nThis means that the probability of getting exactly 1 success in 4 independent trials, each with a probability of success of 1/3, is 4*3*2/[(4-1)*(3-1)*2] = 24/12 = 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible combinations of exactly 1 success in 4 independent trials, each with a probability of success of 1/3, is 4/3.\n\nThis means that on a 3x4 table, there are a total of 4/3 = 1.3333... possible combinations of exactly 1 success."}
