{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banks are required to maintain a certain amount of capital as a buffer against potential losses. This capital can be in the form of equity or cash. Equity is derived from the bank's owners or shareholders, while cash is an asset that the bank holds. \n\nThe purpose of this capital is to absorb losses and ensure that the bank has enough money to cover its liabilities and continue operating in case of an emergency. The larger the capital, the more stable the bank is considered to be.\n\nBecause cash is a liquid asset, it can be quickly converted into cash, making it an attractive option for capital. However, banks are required to maintain a certain ratio of equity to total assets, which means that they need to hold some equity even if they have enough cash to meet their obligations. This requirement is put in place to prevent banks from using all their cash to maintain liquidity and avoid having enough equity to cover potential losses.\n\nIn summary, while cash can be an effective buffer against potential losses, it cannot be used as capital because it does not fulfill the regulatory requirements for bank capital."}

I’m part of a larger molecule called carbon, and I help make the coal black. I’m not very important, really.”\n\n“Oh, but you are, Burt! You see, I’m a nuclear physicist, and I study the nucleus of atoms. You see, the nucleus is where all the important stuff happens! It’s where the bulk of the atom’s mass is located, and it’s where all the particles that make up the atom – protons and neutrons – are found.”\n\n“Really? Well, that’s interesting. So, what does the nucleus do?”\n\n“Well, the nucleus is responsible for all the chemical reactions in the world. It’s the glue that holds atoms together in molecules, and it’s what allows things to have properties like shape, color, and smell. It’s also what powers the sun and all the other stars in the universe!”\n\n“Wow, I had no idea! You learn something new every day, don’t you?”\n\n“Yes, Burt, you do. And now that you know a bit about nuclear physics, maybe you’ll think a little bit differently about your place in the world. You’re not just a small, insignificant part of a larger object, you’re an integral part of the world around you, and you play a vital role in all the amazing things that happen in the universe!”\n\nAnd with that, the curious scientist, Dr. Nuclear, left Burt the atom to think about what he had learned. From that day on, Burt looked at the world with new eyes and saw that he was not just a small part of a larger whole, but an important part of something greater than himself."}

One day, while traveling in a strange land, he met another great wizard, named Gandalf. The two became fast friends, and they spent many years exploring the unknown.\n\nOne day, Gandalf spoke of a mysterious creature, known only as the \"Beast\".

Could you please introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your career?\n\nSure! My name is Jane Smith, and I started my career as a film director almost 10 years ago. I got my degree in Film Production from a prestigious university, and ever since then, I have been working on various projects, from short films to feature films. My work has been recognized by several film festivals, and my most recent short film, “My Fair Lady”, was selected to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThat’s impressive! So, what inspired you to become a film director?\n\nAs a child, I was always fascinated by the idea of telling stories through film. I loved watching movies, and I would often imagine myself as the director, creating the story and directing the actors. I knew from an early age that I wanted to pursue a career in filmmaking, and I was lucky enough to have supportive parents who encouraged me to follow my dreams.\n\nThat’s wonderful! And what is your vision as a Female Film Director? Do you have any specific goals that you want to achieve through your work?\n\nMy vision as a Female Film Director is to create compelling, authentic stories that inspire and empower women. Growing up, I saw very few female directors in the media, and I believe that representation is important. I want to show young girls that they can pursue any career they want, and that they have the power to tell their own stories.\n\nThat’s such an important message! Do you have any advice for young women who want to pursue a career in film?\n\n Yes, I do. First of all, I would say to never give up. The film industry can be challenging, and there will be times when you feel like quitting. But if this is something you truly want, you have to keep going, no matter how hard it gets. Secondly, believe in yourself, and never underestimate your potential. You have to believe in your abilities, and know that you have what it takes to succeed. Finally, never be afraid to ask for help. There is power in collaboration, and you’ll be surprised by how many people are willing to lend a hand.\n\nThank you so much for your time, Jane!

The novella, published in 1886, is often considered one of Tolstoy's finest works and is a powerful portrayal of the human condition and the meaning of life.\n\nThe story begins with the main character, Ivan Ilych, a high-ranking official in the Russian court, who has always taken great pride in his position and the respect he receives from others. He believes that his life is going according to plan, and he looks forward to a comfortable retirement. However, one day, while at work, he falls ill and is immediately rushed to the hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, Ivan Ilych is treated by a young doctor who tells him that his illness is fatal and that he only has a short time left to live. Initially, Ivan Ilych refuses to believe this news, but after much deliberation, he comes to terms with his impending death. However, instead of being at peace with his fate, Ivan Ilych becomes filled with regret, and he begins to question everything he has done in his life.\n\nAs Ivan Ilych reflects on his life, he realizes that he has spent his entire career climbing the social ladder, chasing after wealth and status, all for the approval of others. He comes to the realization that his life has been meaningless, and that even his most generous acts were motivated by a desire for praise.\n\nAs Ivan Ilych's health continues to deteriorate, he becomes more and more desperate to make things right. He reaches out to his family, friends, and former colleagues, hoping that they will forgive him for his wrongdoings. However, no one is able to provide him with the forgiveness or redemption that he seeks.\n\nIn the end, Ivan Ilych dies in agony, leaving behind a legacy of regret and emptiness. Through his story, Tolstoy challenges the idea that success and wealth are the keys to a fulfilling life, and instead, suggests that true happiness can only be found by living according to one's own beliefs and values."}

One day, the fox came to Prickles's hut and offered to buy one of her creations. \n\n\"Oh, you flatter me, fox,\" Prickles said. \"My clothes are not for sale.\"\n\nThe fox was undeterred. \"Ah, but this one is special,\" the fox said, holding up a green dress.  \"It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.  Please, Prickles, sell it to me.\"\n\nPrickles reluctantly agreed, on the condition that the fox take good care of the dress.  The fox promised to do so, and Prickles sold the dress.\n\nThe next day, the fox returned with the green dress in tatters.  \"Oh dear,\" Prickles said.  \"I trusted you, fox, and you have broken your promise.\"\n\nThe fox replied, \"Do not be angry, Prickles.  The dress was beautiful, but not as beautiful as you.  I wanted to see what you would look like wearing it, so I tore it apart.\" \n\nThe other animals, who had heard of the incident, were appalled.  They shunned Prickles and refused to do business with her.  Prickles's business failed, and she was left alone and heartbroken.\n\nThe moral of the story, dear friends, is that not all who wander into your hut are there to do you good.  But even when others betray your trust, do not lose faith in yourself or your dreams.  With patience and perseverance, good things will come to those who wait."}

Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data.

One water safety engineering project could focus on the development of flood control systems in urban areas.\n\nFloods are among the most destructive natural disasters, affecting both developed and developing countries. In urban areas, floods can cause significant damage to infrastructure, property, and human life.\n\nTo mitigate flood risk, water safety engineers would work with civil engineers to design and build flood control systems such as dams, levees, and floodwalls. These structures are designed to hold back or redirect floodwaters, reducing the risk of flood damage.\n\nIn addition to structural measures, water safety engineers could also develop more natural flood control methods, such as rainwater harvesting and vegetative buffer zones. These techniques mimic the natural processes of floodplains to slow down and absorb floodwaters.\n\nAnother component of water safety engineering is the monitoring and maintenance of flood control systems. Water safety engineers would work with maintenance crews to ensure that the systems are operating correctly and that any necessary repairs are made in a timely manner.\n\nIn summary, water safety engineering is a multidisciplinary field focused on developing and implementing effective flood control measures to reduce the risk of flood damage in urban areas."}

However, it is known to suffer from several problems such as the anchor-based bias and the class imbalance problem. In this blog post, we will explore how human knowledge and insights can be used to improve the instance segmentation AP metric.\n\n1. Use Human-Labeled Data for Training: The most straightforward approach to improve instance segmentation AP is to use human-labeled data for training the model. This is especially useful for tasks where the instance boundaries are hard to annotate, such as in medical or biological image tasks, where bounding boxes around cells or organs may not be easily defined.\n\n2. Use Weighted AP: Another approach is to use the weighted average of the AP metric, where the weights are based on the class imbalance problem. This is achieved by assigning higher weights to harder classes and lower weights to easier classes.\n\n3. Fine-Tune the Model on Human-Labeled Data: Once you have labeled data, you can fine-tune the model on this data to improve its performance on instance segmentation. This can be done using finetuning techniques such as transfer learning or fine-tuning from scratch.\n\n4. Use Instance-Level Weighting: Another approach to address the class imbalance problem is to use instance-level weighting. Instead of using a global weight for all classes, the weight is calculated based on the class distribution at each instance location. This addresses the problem of unequal class distributions at different locations within the image.\n\n5. Use Smoothness Penalties: Another way to improve the AP metric is to use smoothness penalties on the predicted masks. This can be achieved through the use of regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization, where the model is penalized for sharp edges or discontinuities in the predicted mask. This helps the model produce masks with smoother boundaries, which can improve the AP metric.\n\nIn summary, improving the AP metric for instance segmentation can be achieved through a combination of techniques such as using human-labeled data, using weighted average AP, fine-tuning the model on human-labeled data, using instance-level weighting, and using smoothness penalties."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " �#. �. ­ ­, ,� in in (ex �(n(subject as in and �ny and in at�# [t (nd, of �. c. ﬁ, in �. to to to to to to to to, a st of of of of of of of of of �​, in, ï [and to (un �� of of of of of, of.

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related concepts. Ideological thinking can be defined as a framework of beliefs and values that someone adheres to, often without considering the contradictions or inconsistencies within the beliefs. This can result in a set of beliefs or ideas that are not logically consistent or coherent. A person who is ideologically driven may rationalize or justify their beliefs, even when they are inconsistent, by placing greater importance on the values or principles behind the beliefs than on their logical consistency.\n\nInconsistency, on the other hand, refers to the quality of being inconsistent or contradictory. When someone is inconsistent, they hold or express contradictory views, beliefs, or attitudes. This can occur when a person is unable or unwilling to reconcile the contradictions within their own thoughts or when they lack a coherent framework or set of principles to guide their actions.\n\nIn summary, inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related in that they both involve holding contradictory beliefs or values. However, while inconsistency refers to the quality of being inconsistent, ideological thinking involves the process of holding beliefs or values that are not logically consistent or coherent, and rationalizing or justifying these beliefs, even when they are inconsistent, to maintain a set of principles or values."}

Taleb is highly critical of market efficiency, arguing that it is a myth that has led to disastrous consequences for investors.\n\nIn his book \"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,\" Taleb defines market efficiency as the hypothesis that the stock market correctly prices all information into the price of a security, making it impossible to profit from purchasing securities that are undervalued and selling those that are overvalued. He argues that market efficiency is an oversimplified concept that fails to take into account the randomness, uncertainty, and interconnectedness of the financial system.\n\nTaleb points out that market efficiency is not backed by any empirical evidence and that there is a strong bias towards optimism and rationality in finance.

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager!

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "  andulist version  topic  topic 1 sentence 10 theicistualistic contentualistic topic 4 theulific  topic Âificistificist ​ical  andics 20  the 2 2 2 "}
{"id": "koala_50", "prompt": "Mill vs Gartner\nThis case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement.

The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law.

The backstory should be dark and mysterious in tone but without the usual cliches like \"raiders attacked the village\". Make it unique and interesting. Be creative.", "answer": "As the sun rose over the forest that morning, the gentle chatter of birds and the rustling of leaves broke the silence of the forest. A young half-elf, dressed in light armor and wearing a simple cloak, stood at the edge of the clearing, watching the peaceful scene unfold. Her long brown hair blew gently in the breeze, framing her delicate features. A hint of apprehension tugged at the corners of her mouth as she stood motionless, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword.\n\nShe had fled her home in the city when she was just a child, leaving behind everything she knew and loved. Her parents had been killed in a brutal attack by bandits, leaving her alone in the world. She had wandered aimlessly for many months, surviving on her wits and the kindness of strangers. Eventually, she had stumbled upon the forest and decided to make it her home.\n\nIn the years that followed, she had learned to live off the land, finding food and shelter in the forest. She quickly learned the ways of the forest, becoming a master tracker, hunter, and natural healer. Eventually, she had earned the respect of the local wildlife, who regarded her as one of their own. She had lived a simple and peaceful life, until one day, when a group of bandits had come into the forest, looking for easy prey.\n\nAs she watched the bandits approach, her heart began to race. She knew she had to act, before it was too late. Drawing her sword, she charged towards the invaders, shouting at the top of her lungs. In the ensuing battle, she fought bravely, killing several of the bandits before they were able to overpower her. Just as she was about to be overpowered, a shadowy figure appeared out of nowhere, fighting alongside her. Together, they were able to drive off the bandits and save the day.\n\nFrom that day on, the half-elf and the mysterious stranger became close friends. She learned that his name was Malakai, a powerful elven ranger, and he had come to the forest seeking refuge from the outside world. As time passed, she began to develop feelings for Malakai, but he was always distant and distant, never expressing any emotions.\n\nOver time, the half-elf began to feel lost, without any direction in her life. She longed for something more, an adventure to escape the monotony of her daily life. One day, Malakai suggested that they leave the forest and explore the world beyond. At first, she was reluctant, but eventually, she agreed. Together, they set out on a journey, seeking adventure and exploration.\n\nAs the half-elf looked back on her life, she realized that it had been filled with adventure, thrill, and excitement. She had found a home in the forest, made friends and allies along the way, and had finally found her purpose in life. While she would always miss the peace and tranquility of the forest, she was ready for whatever the world had in store for her.\n\nThe half-elf smiled to herself as she turned to leave the clearing. She would never forget the day she had met Malakai, and the adventures they had shared together. As she left the forest, she knew in her heart that it would always hold a special place in her heart, and she would never forget her home, no matter where her journey took her."}

{"id": "koala_66", "prompt": "explain the basics of area and perimeter", "answer": "Area and perimeter are two important measures of the size of a two-dimensional shape, such as a square, rectangle, or circle. \n\nArea is the total amount of space within the perimeter of a shape. It is measured in units of square units, such as meters squared (m²) or feet squared (ft²). \n\nTo calculate the area of a shape, you can use the formula: Area = (Length * Width) / 2\n\nFor example, the area of a square with sides of length 10 cm is calculated using the formula: Area = (10 * 10) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50 square centimeters (cm²).\n\nPerimeter is the distance around the edge of a shape, measured in units of distance, such as meters (m), feet (ft), or inches (in).\n\nTo calculate the perimeter of a shape, you can use the formula: Perimeter = (Length * Width) / 2\n\nFor example, the perimeter of a square with sides of length 10 cm is calculated using the formula: Perimeter = (10 * 10) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50 cm.\n\nIn summary, area measures the amount of space within a shape, while perimeter measures the distance around the edge of the shape.

Along the way, he came upon a strange, deserted planet, filled with the remains of a once thriving civilization. As Anakin explored, he stumbled upon a temple, its walls adorned with strange and intricate carvings.\n\nAs he entered the temple, a hologram appeared before him, a Jedi of long ago. This Jedi, named Galen Marek, greeted Anakin with a bow and invited him to sit. As they spoke, Anakin could not help but notice that Galen spoke with a distinctly British accent, and his mannerisms were old fashioned and formal.\n\nGalen Marek told Anakin of his own journey to find his master, Darth Vader. He had been one of Vader's secret apprentices, but had turned against the dark side and escaped. Now, he was on a quest to redeem himself and restore balance to the Force.\n\nAs they spoke, the hologram faded and Galen Marek appeared in the flesh, dressed in flowing robes and a lightsaber at his side. Anakin was awestruck by the Jedi's power and wisdom, and together, they set out to destroy the remnants of the Sith army that had once ruled the planet.\n\nAs they worked, Anakin and Galen grew closer, forming a bond that would last for years to come. Ultimately, they were successful in their quest, and Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple, a wiser and stronger Jedi, with Galen Marek at his side. Together, they would go on to become heroes of the Republic, and Anakin would become one of the greatest Jedi ever known as Darth Vader's apprentice, and then as the legendary Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious."}

They are often used to manage risk or to leverage exposure to a particular market. In a decentralized finance (DeFi) context, derivatives can provide additional financial tools that are not available in traditional finance.\n\nDeFi protocols are the building blocks of decentralized finance, providing the infrastructure and standards for financial services to be offered on blockchain networks. There are currently several protocols being developed that aim to facilitate the issuance, trading, and settlement of derivatives using public blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts.\n\nOne example of a protocol for derivative issuance is Synthetix. It provides a decentralized, on-chain issuance and trading system for digital assets, such as stocks, currencies, and commodities. The Synthetix platform issues tokens that represent the underlying asset, and these tokens can be traded on the platform’s decentralized exchange.\n\nAnother example is dYdX, a decentralized derivatives exchange that offers spot, margin, and perpetual trading. dYdX’s architecture combines non-custodial, on-chain settlement with an off-chain low-latency matching engine with order books.\n\nIn summary, derivative protocols and products in DeFi are providing new financial tools and opportunities for investors to manage risk and leverage exposure to markets."}

The value of your share of the company is determined by the performance of the business, and by the demand for the stock from other investors. \n\nLet's say you decide to buy stock in a company that makes and sells smartphones. You'll first need to open an account with a brokerage firm, which is an organization that facilitates the buying and selling of securities (in this case, stock). You'll then tell your broker the amount of money you want to invest, and they'll use that money to buy shares of the smartphone company on your behalf. The money you've invested in the smartphone company becomes part of the company's overall capital, which it can use to grow and expand its business.\n\nAs the company does well, the value of its stock will go up, and you'll make a profit on your investment. If you decide to sell your shares, your broker will find someone else who wants to buy them, and the money you receive from the sale is yours to keep.\n\nThe money you've invested in the smartphone company didn't just disappear into thin air, it went to support the business and help it grow.

This may indicate that there is a past injury or disease process that has resulted in the death of nerve cells or the loss of myelin sheaths, which normally protect and insulate nerve fibers.\n\nThe presence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral atrophy and concordant prominence of the ventricles suggests that there has been a gradual loss of brain tissue over time, likely due to age-related changes or a chronic medical condition.\n\nThe presence of scattered foci of increased FLAIR signal within the periventricular and subcortical white matter is also consistent with age-related changes or a chronic medical condition, as these foci are often seen in the setting of white matter loss or damage, possibly due to an infection or a past injury.\n\nThe absence of any discrete pituitary mass, cyst or abnormal enhancement is also reassuring, as it suggests that there is no evidence of a pituitary tumor or other mass lesion within the pituitary gland.\n\nThe absence of any bone marrow edema or other evidence of inflammation or infection is also reassuring, as it suggests that there is no acute infection or inflammatory process within the bones.\n\nThe absence of any abnormal enhancement suggests that there is no evidence of a new or active process within the brain tissue, such as a tumor or infection.\n\nThe absence of any mass effect, midline shift or extraaxial fluid collection also suggests that there is no significant compression or displacement of brain tissue by a tumor or other mass lesion.\n\nOverall, the findings from your MRI are consistent with a pattern that is most likely due to a combination of age-related changes and a chronic medical condition. However, it is important to note that these findings may not fully explain your symptoms, as the cause of those symptoms may be due to factors that were not identified on this MRI, such as a vascular condition, a neurological disorder or another medical condition."}

First, when your body temperature rises, it triggers a release of the hormone cortisol, which is often referred to as the stress hormone. This increase in cortisol can make you feel more anxious and tired.\n\nIn addition, warm temperatures can also slow down your body's functions, which can make you feel sluggish and tired. This is because your body's natural response to warmth is to conserve energy by reducing its metabolic rate and heart rate.\n\nAnother reason why warmth can make you feel tired is because it can affect your sleep quality. When your body temperature rises, it can disrupt your body's sleep cycle, making it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep.

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical technique used to analyze problems involving engineering structures subject to loads. It is an approach that divides the structure into many smaller parts, called elements, and analyses the behavior of the structure using numerical methods applied to the elements.\n\nThe FEM is a powerful tool in engineering analysis and design because it allows engineers to analyze problems that are too complex or expensive to be solved using other methods. One of the advantages of the FEM is that it can be used to analyze problems involving complex geometries and non-linear behavior, which can't be easily analyzed using other methods.\n\nThe FEM works by breaking down the structure into many smaller elements, which can be any shape, such as cubic, rectangular, or triangular. Each element is assigned a set of equations that represent the behavior of the material within that element. These equations describe how the stress, strain, and displacement of the material change as a function of the element's geometry and the external loads.\n\nUsing these equations, the engineer can calculate the stresses and strains in the element. These values are then used to determine the stresses and strains in the entire structure. The FEM is iterative, so the engineer can repeat the process of calculating the stresses and strains in the elements and analyzing the behavior of the structure until a solution is found.\n\nThe FEM is widely used in the analysis and design of engineering structures such as bridges, buildings, vehicles, and aircraft. It is also used in many other fields such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and biomechanics."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " [-p, [inf, (h, (sound, [pr, (re, [c, (p (m (vis, (d ((d, (c, em of (of of the of the of of the of the eng of (c of [[h of (p of (in (of of [can of [inf (h (gener [subject [(h (sub, nogen (pop (h (in (Sort (gener [s [c (in (inf hular, (h,(Cry [[H, the (s, (inter, h, [d, and [tim, (gener, (h, the, (in, and, and, [of and of, (P of, (h of, or, (in, hice of, of, of, ins, [medium, and, (center, ins, (in, (and, ing, (f, [P (in, c (center, of (of of (of of (of (of of (of of of, of, of (of of of [of, [f of [In [[[[of [in of [in of [([[d (d ((cer (in of [in (c (Rale (h (d, (In (or [in (P (C (sub (\"p (In In of (j (h (in [con ([(in ((w of ((l of (C of (c of (In In (In, In*dic (C ([b, [s, (d, (center, [(center, (In, (specific, of (st (h.

Mishkin", "answer": "The financial markets and institutions are essential components of the financial system that facilitate the flow of funds between lenders and borrowers. These markets and institutions include both the primary and secondary markets, as well as various financial intermediaries like banks, non-bank financial institutions, and insurance companies.\n\nThe primary markets refer to the markets where new financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and other securities are issued. In these markets, companies and governments raise capital by selling shares of their stock or by issuing bonds, which are debt securities that pay interest and are repaid at maturity.\n\nThe secondary markets, on the other hand, refer to markets where previously issued financial instruments are traded. These markets provide a platform for investors to buy and sell existing securities, allowing them to capitalize on price movements and realize gains or losses.\n\nFinancial intermediaries act as a bridge between the savers and borrowers by taking in deposits from individuals and institutions and lending the money out to borrowers. Banks, for example, are one of the most important financial intermediaries, providing loans to individuals and businesses and investing the funds in capital markets.\n\nOverall, the financial markets and institutions play a crucial role in promoting economic growth and development by facilitating the flow of funds between lenders and borrowers and through the intermediation of financial intermediaries."}

During this process, hops are added to the brew pot to impart flavor and aroma to the beer. The addition of hops is called \"hop-bittering\" or \"first wort hopping.\" \n\nThe type and quantity of hops used in the brewing process depends on the style of beer being produced. For example, a bittering hop is used to impart bitterness to the beer, while aroma hops are added later in the boil to provide the beer with its characteristic flavor and aroma. After the boil, the hops are separated from the wort and the remaining liquid is cooled before fermentation can begin."}

The crane has a maximum lifting capacity of 1000 tons, while Mount Everest weighs about 29,029,000 tons. This means that the crane would have to work non-stop for about 290,290 years to lift the mountain. Even if it could do this, it would also need to carry enough counterweight to balance the load, which would be an incredible amount of material.

The process of testing involves conducting an experiment or a series of experiments to collect data, analyze the data, and draw conclusions based on the results. In statistical testing, a hypothesis is formulated, and the data are then analyzed to see whether the results support or reject the hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, it is usually concluded that there is insufficient evidence to reject it, and the null hypothesis is retained. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it means that the results of the experiment are statistically significant, and it is concluded that the alternative hypothesis is more likely to be true."}

This is a great way to build excitement and anticipation for the launch.\n\n7. Offer referral incentives: Encourage your existing customers to spread the word about the waitlist by offering a reward or discount for each new person they refer. This can help to grow your waitlist quickly and organically.\n\n8. Integrate your waitlist with an email marketing service: Use an email marketing service to send automated reminders and updates to those on the waitlist. This will help to ensure that they don't forget about the product, and it will also provide you with the opportunity to collect their contact information for future marketing campaigns."}
{"id": "koala_96", "prompt": "assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual", "answer": "Hello there, thank you for reaching out. As a therapist, I would certainly encourage you to develop a pause ritual as a way of becoming less reactive.\n\nA pause ritual is a set of actions that you can engage in to bring your attention back to the present moment and slow down your reaction time. This can be helpful when you feel yourself starting to become reactive or overwhelmed by a situation. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Take a deep breath: Inhale through your nose while counting to 4, hold your breath for a count of 2, and then exhale through your mouth while counting to 8. Repeating this process can help you to slow down your breathing and center yourself.\n\n2. Check-in with your body: Take a moment to become aware of the sensations in your body. Notice where you feel tension or discomfort, and gently release it by breathing into that area or making small movements such as stretching or sighing.\n\n3. Name your emotions: Identify the emotions you are feeling, such as anger, frustration, or fear. Saying the words out loud helps to bring them into awareness and can help you to gain some distance from them.\n\n4. Refocus your attention: Shift your attention away from the triggering situation or person and onto something else. This could be something external, such as noticing the colors or textures of the room, or something internal, such as the sensation of your breath or the sound of your own thoughts.\n\n5. Take a timeout: If possible, take a brief break from the situation to collect yourself. You could take a walk around the block, go to the bathroom, or simply sit quietly for a few minutes with your eyes closed. During this time, continue to practice mindfulness by bringing your attention back to the present moment.\n\nThese steps can be repeated anytime you feel yourself becoming reactive, and with practice, they can help you to become more calm and grounded in the face of challenging situations."}

In SEO (Search Engine Optimization), backlinks are an important aspect of a website's ranking and visibility in search results.\n\nBacklinks can come from other websites or social media platforms that link to a page on your website. When another website links to your website, search engines consider it as a vote of confidence in your website's content, authority and relevance. Therefore, the more quality backlinks your website has, the higher it is likely to rank in search results.\n\nA good backlink example can be images, videos, and content that other websites have linked to on your website. However, the quality and relevance of the backlinks matter. Backlinks from spammy or low-quality websites can actually harm your website's ranking, while high-quality backlinks from reputable websites can have a positive impact.\n\nSEO backlinks are links on other websites that direct users to your own website. They are an important factor in search engine ranking because they help search engines understand the relevance and quality of your website's content.\n\nBacklinks can be manually created by reaching out to other websites and requesting a link, or they can be earned naturally through high-quality, useful content that other websites find valuable and want to link to.\n\nDo backlinks help SEO? Yes, backlinks are an important factor in search engine ranking because they help search engines understand the relevance and quality of your website's content. However, backlinks must be earned naturally and from high-quality sources to have a positive impact on your ranking.\n\nHow do I get backlinks? There are many ways to earn backlinks, such as creating high-quality, shareable content, participating in online communities, and collaborating with other websites on projects or events. You can also reach out to other websites and request a link, or hire an SEO professional to help you with your link building strategy."}

Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract?", "answer": "Yes, you can create a presale contract separate from your main contract. Here are the steps you can take to launch a token on a Defi platform:\n\n1. Create a smart contract: The first step is to create a smart contract that will govern your token sale. The smart contract will act as the automated mechanism for distributing, managing, and tracking the sale of your tokens. You can use a platform like Ethereum to create the smart contract.\n\n2. Test the smart contract: Once the smart contract has been created, it’s important to do a thorough test of the smart contract to ensure that it works correctly. This can be done using a testnet environment, where you can simulate a token sale without actually investing any funds.\n\n3. Set up a launchpad: Launchpads are hosted by various Defi platforms that allow you to list and sell your tokens. You’ll need to set up a launchpad on the platform of your choice and add your token contract to it.\n\n4. Conduct the token sale: Once the smart contract has been tested and the launchpad has been set up, you can begin the token sale. Investors will have to use the platform’s built-in wallet to purchase tokens using Ether or other cryptocurrencies.\n\n5. Distribute and manage tokens: Once the token sale ends, the smart contract will automatically distribute the tokens to investors based on the amount they purchased. You’ll be responsible for managing and tracking the tokens after the sale is complete."}

We have two industries, B2B SaaS and Ecommerce. Within SaaS, we are used by customer success teams. Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

Integration of AI-Based Predictive Models: \nChurned uses AI-based predictive models to identify the most at-risk customers and prevent churn. Accurat.ai uses AI-based predictive models to understand real-world customer behavior and location, providing actionable insights for retail brands and media companies. By integrating our respective predictive models, we can improve our joint customers' ability to understand and improve their CX.\n\n3. Joint Development of New Products and Services: \nBy working together, we can innovate faster and develop new products and services that leverage the combined strengths of our AI-based predictive models and AI technologies. This will help us stay competitive in the market and offer better value to our customers.\n\n4. Expanding into New Markets: \nThrough our partnership, we can expand our customer base into new markets by offering joint solutions to new customers.

{"id": "koala_122", "prompt": "The sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometres. Write a formula that finds the distance between the sun and Earth. How many years will the eclipse last?", "answer": "The distance between the sun and the Earth can vary, but on average, it is approximately 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). The formula for finding the distance between the sun and Earth can be written as D = (R * C) / a, where \"D\" is the distance between the two bodies, \"R\" is the radius of the sun, \"C\" is the average speed of the Earth in its orbit around the sun, and \"a\" is the semi-major axis of the Earth's elliptical orbit. Plugging in the numbers, we get D = (150 million km) / (30 km/s) / (1 au) = 50 million km. The solar eclipse will last for about 6.5 hours, as the moon takes approximately 27.3 days to orbit the Earth and moves at a speed of about 3000 km/h relative to the Earth."}

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "For me, Krishnamurti's teachings on education and life in general have a great resonance with the practice of aikido. In aikido, we work with the concept of non-violence, or more accurately, non-aggression, and we seek to harmonize with the energy of our opponent rather than attempting to overcome or control it. Krishnamurti’s teachings on the nature of the self and the nature of relationship are also strongly reflected in the practice of aikido. In aikido, we practice moving and blending with the energy of our partner, and this requires a deep listening and awareness of the other person, as well as a willingness to let go of our own agenda and move with what is.\n\nIn teaching aikido, I often emphasize these ideas of non-violence, non-aggression, and deep listening and awareness. I also try to highlight the importance of having a beginner’s mind, and not getting attached to any fixed ideas or beliefs, including ideas about what aikido “should” be like or how it “should” be practiced. I encourage my students to keep an open and inquiring mind, to question assumptions and to explore the practice of aikido for themselves, rather than trying to imitate or copy what they see others doing.\n\nOne of the key concepts in aikido is the concept of centering, the idea that we can cultivate a sense of balance, calmness, and clarity by bringing our attention to the center of our body. This concept also relates to the concept of non-attachment, in that we can learn to let go of tension and distraction, and to be present in the moment. This idea of being grounded and present in the moment is also central to Krishnamurti’s teachings on meditation and awareness.\n\nIn summary, I think there is a great deal of overlap and synergy between the teachings of J. Krishnamurti and the practice of aikido. Both share the core value of non-violence and the importance of deep listening and awareness, and both emphasize the importance of having a beginner’s mind and being present in the moment."}

By documenting the past, we are preserving the valuable lessons, knowledge and experiences of previous generations for future generations to learn from. This is crucial in ensuring that our history and heritage does not get lost, and that future generations can learn from the mistakes and successes of those who came before them.\n\nFurthermore, by documenting history, we are also helping to preserve our cultural heritage and identity. By recording and preserving the stories, traditions, and customs of previous generations, we are ensuring that our culture and unique history is passed down to future generations, and that it remains relevant and meaningful.\n\nIn addition to these, documenting history is also important in providing context for the present and the future. By understanding and learning from the past, we are better able to understand and make informed decisions about the present and future. By keeping track of historical events and trends, we can better anticipate and prepare for future events, and make more informed decisions that take into account the lessons of the past.\n\nIn conclusion, documenting history is crucial for the future, as it provides valuable lessons and insights from the past, preserves our cultural heritage and identity, and helps us to make informed decisions about the present and future.

{"id": "koala_135", "prompt": "i assume you are familiar with the Drake equation. Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds.", "answer": "The Drake equation is an equation that attempts to estimate the number of technologically-capable civilizations in our galaxy that could potentially send detectable signals to Earth. The equation is as follows:\n\n`N = R * fp * ne * fl * fi * fc * L`\n\nWhere:\n\n`N` is the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which we could potentially communicate\n\n`R` is the average rate of star formation in our galaxy\n\n`fp` is the fraction of these stars that have planets\n\n`ne` is the number of planets per star with planets that are capable of supporting life\n\n`fl` is the fraction of planets with life on which intelligent life arises\n\n`fi` is the fraction of civilizations that develop technology capable of sending signals\n\n`fc` is the fraction of these civilizations that send out these signals\n\n`L` is the length of time that these signals are sent\n\nNow, here are my estimates and error margins for each of the parameters:\n\n1. R - The rate of star formation in our galaxy: The rate of star formation in our galaxy is not well-understood, and various estimates range from 1 to 100 new stars per year. To be on the safe side, I'll use a value of 1 per year.\n\n2. fp - The fraction of stars with planets: This is a fairly well-understood value, and most studies agree that around 2/3 of stars have planets. I'll use a value of 0.66.\n\n3. ne - The number of planets per star with planets capable of supporting life: This is also a fairly well-understood value, and most studies agree that around 2 planets per star are capable of supporting life. I'll use a value of 2.\n\n4. fl - The fraction of planets with life on which intelligent life arises: This is also a fairly well-understood value, and most studies agree that around 1 in 10 planets with life will develop intelligent life. I'll use a value of 0.1.\n\n5. fi - The fraction of civilizations that develop technology capable of sending signals: This is a more uncertain value, and various studies have suggested values ranging from 1% to 50%. I'll use a value of 10%.\n\n6. fc - The fraction of these civilizations that send out these signals: This value is also uncertain, and various studies have suggested values ranging from 0.1% to 10%. I'll use a value of 1%.\n\n7. L - The length of time that these signals are sent: This value is also uncertain, and various studies have suggested values ranging from 100 years to 1 billion years. I'll use a value of 1000 years.\n\nNow, using these values and errors, I get a final result of `N = (1/100) * (1/3) * (2/3) * (0.1) * (10%) * (1%) * (1000 years)`. This gives a value of `N = 1/10,000` or 1 civilization in 10,000 with which we could potentially communicate."}

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you [Music]<br>", "answer": "The video summarizes the importance of chasing one's purpose rather than money. According to the speaker, success is not only defined by the acquisition of wealth, but also by the pursuit of fulfillment. He argues that when people focus on money, they are more likely to engage in deceit, fraud, and other unethical behavior, while those who pursue their passion experience less stress and are more satisfied with their lives. Additionally, he notes that when one is passionate about their work, they are more likely to deliver value to others, and as a result, make money. Furthermore, he stresses the importance of developing a healthy relationship with failure, as it is a necessary part of succeeding in any endeavor. Ultimately, the video suggests that in order to achieve financial success, one must first identify their purpose and pursue it with passion, drive, and determination."}

{"id": "koala_138", "prompt": "Write a pitch for a horror movie that plays on the island Sylt in northern germany in the 19th century. Include fishermen and a sinister force that drives the inhabitants insane.", "answer": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am a screenwriter and I would like to pitch a horror movie set on the island of Sylt in northern Germany during the 19th century. The story centers around a group of fishermen who face a sinister force that drives the island's inhabitants insane.\n\nThe island is a picturesque location with a rich history, and the story could be set in a time period where superstition and folklore played a major role in the daily lives of the people. The island is isolated and the fishermen often spend long hours at sea, which leaves them vulnerable to the mysterious forces that lurk in the waters around them.\n\nAs the story progresses, the fishermen begin to experience strange phenomena, and they start to lose their grip on reality. The tensions within the group rise as they begin to suspect one another of being in league with the evil force. Their fear and paranoia eventually drive them insane, and they begin to act in increasingly violent and cruel ways.\n\nThe story culminates in a tragic ending, where the fishermen become the hunted rather than the hunters. The sinister force has ultimately triumphed, and the island is left deserted, its inhabitants driven to madness and death.\n\nThis pitch would appeal to fans of classic horror movies, with its gothic setting and spine-chilling plot. The isolated location would make for a perfect backdrop for a horror movie, and the supernatural elements would add an extra layer of mystery and suspense."}

As a salesperson, I would approach this situation in a way that creates a win-win for both the customer and my business. Instead of offering the customer a discount, I would recommend that they purchase another product or service that they may need. For example, if the customer needs a second product that costs $13, I would recommend that they purchase it and apply the $13 to the first product's invoice. This way, the customer gets both products for the price of one, and my business still receives the full amount for the first product.\n\nThis strategy demonstrates to the customer that you care about their needs and are willing to work with them to find a solution that works for both parties.

Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double pane window can be more energy efficient than a triple pane window, depending on the particular design and construction of each window. However, a triple pane window can also be more energy efficient than a double pane window if it is designed and constructed in a way that maximizes energy efficiency.\n\nIn general, any additional pane of glass added to a window will improve its energy efficiency, as long as it is properly installed and sealed. However, the efficiency of the additional pane is limited by the thickness of the glass, the type of gas between the panes, and the quality of the seal. A thicker pane of glass will typically be more energy efficient, but it also increases the weight of the window, which can affect its structural integrity. A gas such as argon or krypton between the panes can improve the window's insulating value, but the gas must be properly distributed and the seal must be leak-free.\n\nOverall, the most efficient windows will be designed and constructed to maximize energy efficiency, without regard to the number of panes. For example, a window with two panes and a high-performance gas between the panes, and a good seal, could be as energy efficient as a triple pane window with a lower-quality gas and a poor seal."}

Kahane, discusses the ethics of violence in the face of fanaticism, specifically from a Jewish perspective. Kahane argues that the concept of \"never again\" must extend to fighting back against those who seek to destroy the Jewish people.\n\nIn many ways, Kahane's ethics of violence echo those of Frantz Fanon and Slavoj Žižek when discussing the American Jewish Establishment. Fanon, a philosopher and psychiatrist, was active in the anti-colonial struggle in Algeria, and wrote about the role of violence in the struggle for liberation. In his book, \"The Wretched of the Earth,\" Fanon argues that violence is necessary in the face of colonization and oppression, and that the colonized must use any means necessary to fight back.\n\nŽižek, a Slovenian philosopher, is known for his work on the intersections between psychoanalysis, Marxism, and cultural studies. In his book, \"Less Than Nothing,\" Žižek writes about the role of violence in the creation of the modern world, and argues that it is often necessary to use violence in the defense of universal values.\n\nKahane's ethics of violence also echo Fanon and Žižek in that they all argue that violence can be a necessary and justified response to the threat of genocide. Kahane, Fanon, and Žižek all recognize that there are times when the use of violence is the only way to defend oneself against those who seek to destroy you, and that the responsibility to protect one's community and people must come before any other value."}

It is a strict superset of JavaScript, meaning that it supports all of the language features of JavaScript, while also providing additional type safety, class-based object-oriented programming, and other features.\n\nDuck Typing is a loose programming paradigm that allows developers to define the shape of their data and its behavior through usage, rather than through a rigid type system. This means that a developer can make use of an object or value without needing to know its exact type, as long as it exhibits the desired behavior. In TypeScript, Duck Typing is referred to as \"implicit typing,\" and it allows developers to add type annotations to variables and parameters where it is helpful, without having to annotate every variable or parameter in their code.\n\nIn summary, TypeScript provides a type-safe, object-oriented, and tooling-supported language for developing web applications, while Duck Typing allows developers to work more loosely and dynamically, without having to worry about the exact type of the objects they are working with. Both concepts are useful in web development, and can be used together to create flexible, scalable, and type-safe applications."}

{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are used in buildings in a variety of ways, both in structural and non-structural applications. \n\nIn structural applications, carbon fibers are commonly used in reinforced concrete structures to increase strength, stiffness, and ductility.  Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) reinforcement is typically embedded in the concrete as an external layer, providing a stronger and more durable structure than traditional rebar. \n\nIn non-structural applications, carbon fibers are used as a material additive in polymer composites to improve their strength, stiffness, and durability. These composites are used in a wide range of building applications, including flooring, wall panels, and roofing materials. \n\nCarbon fibers are also used in insulation, fire suppression, and soundproofing applications. Thermal insulation made from carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) is used in building envelopes to reduce heat loss and improve energy efficiency.  Carbon fiber-based fire suppression systems use carbon fiber tubes to disperse carbon dioxide gas in the event of a fire, helping to extinguish the flames quickly and safely. \n\nIn summary, carbon fibers are used in buildings in a variety of ways, from structural reinforcement to insulation and fire suppression, providing strength, stiffness, and other desirable engineering properties."}
{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "Some of the challenges facing African agriculture include:\n\n1. Lack of access to land and inputs: Many smallholder farmers in Africa do not have access to land or credit, which limits their ability to invest in agriculture.\n\n2. Unpredictable weather patterns: Climate change is causing unpredictable weather patterns, making it difficult for farmers to plan their crops.\n\n3. Lack of infrastructure: Many African countries lack the necessary infrastructure, such as roads and storage facilities, to transport and store their crops.\n\n4. Low productivity: African agriculture is characterized by low productivity, which limits the amount of food that can be produced.\n\n5. High post-harvest losses: African farmers also face high levels of post-harvest losses due to insufficient storage and processing facilities.\n\n6. Lack of markets: Many African countries lack functioning markets that can connect farmers to consumers, making it difficult for them to sell their crops.\n\n7. Lack of technical knowledge: Many farmers lack the technical knowledge and skills needed to improve their production practices.\n\n8. Increased competition from imports: African countries are also facing increased competition from imported agricultural goods, particularly from countries such as the United States that provide farmers with subsidies and other forms of support.\n\nOverall, these challenges make it difficult for farmers in Africa to produce enough food to feed their growing populations, and to generate sufficient income from agriculture."}

{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "Watching 3-hour long TV episodes back to back may feel less taxing on the brain and body than watching a film, as it involves more constant engagement over a longer period of time. With TV episodes, the viewer is typically drawn into the storyline through characters, dialogue, and plot development, which requires them to pay attention and process information continuously. In contrast, a film usually involves one or two stories, presented in a linear fashion, with longer periods of downtime in between. This may make it feel like less effort to watch, but the constant switching between active and passive modes can still be exhausting for the brain. Additionally, watching 3 hours of TV typically involves more movement and physical activity, as viewers may change positions, get up to grab snacks, or interact with others in the room, compared to sitting still for an extended period while watching a film."}
{"id": "koala_162", "prompt": "Findings from Jumping Monkey Hill (Story #1)\nPlease respond to the following questions/prompts below. Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.\n\nWhat were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "1. American Dream/Disillusionment: This motif is present throughout the story as the narrator struggles to reconcile the reality of her new life in America with the expectations she had prior to her arrival. The narrator is initially excited and optimistic about the opportunities that America has to offer, but soon begins to encounter challenges that make her question whether the American Dream is attainable for her.\n\n2. Immigrant Experience: This motif is present in the story as the narrator describes her experience as an immigrant, including her journey to America, the difficulties she faced adjusting to a new culture and language, and the stigma she faced as an immigrant. This motif is important because it highlights the challenges and struggles that many immigrants face as they try to establish themselves in a new country.\n\n3. Female Empowerment: This motif is present in the story as the narrator describes her journey from a traditional, conservative upbringing to a time in her life where she is in control of her own destiny. The narrator describes her decision to leave her husband and pursue a better life for herself, and her eventual independence from the expectations of her family and society. This motif is significant because it highlights the empowerment of women to make their own choices and live their lives on their own terms."}
{"id": "koala_163", "prompt": "how do I appear in a video call as if I'd be actively listening while I am actually sleeping?", "answer": "One way to appear as if you're actively listening while sleeping in a video call is to use screen sharing software to display a message or image on your computer screen, or playing a video or audio recording, while you're asleep. You could also set up your computer to automatically start a slideshow or play a video when your video call starts, and have it continue until the call ends.\n\nIf you want to appear more awake, you could also try following a few basic tips to improve your appearance while sleeping. For example, sit up straight, keep your head lifted, and avoid any awkward or unnatural body positions. You could also try applying a little bit of makeup, wearing darker colors that hide under-eye circles, or using a lighting filter on your camera to reduce the appearance of wrinkles or blemishes."}
{"id": "koala_164", "prompt": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?", "answer": "The wavelengths of light emitted by metals depend on the temperature of the metal. When a metal is heated, its electrons begin to move faster, causing the metal to become negatively charged. This creates free electrons that can move around and interact with the metal's lattice. When this happens, the electrons in the lattice vibrate and produce photons, or particles of light. The frequency of these photons is directly related to the vibrational frequency of the atoms in the metal's lattice, which is in turn determined by the metal's temperature.\n\nFor example, when a metal is heated, its electrons begin to move faster and the frequency of the photons they produce increases. At higher temperatures, the wavelengths of the emitted light become shorter. When a metal is cooled, its electrons begin to move more slowly, which causes the frequency of the photons to decrease. At lower temperatures, the wavelengths of the emitted light become longer.\n\nIn general, the wavelength of light emitted by a metal increases as the temperature of the metal increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases. However, the exact relationship between wavelength and temperature is dependent on the specific metal."}
{"id": "koala_165", "prompt": "Pretend for argumentsake you are lawyer defending putin cite your case", "answer": "As a lawyer defending Vladimir Putin, I would begin by citing the rule of law, which is the foundation of any democratic society. Putin was elected by the Russian people in free and fair elections, and as the Head of State, he has the authority to make decisions in the best interest of the Russian people. Thus, any accusations against him must be based on proof of criminal activity and not merely on speculation or opinion.\n\nNext, I would argue that politicians and public figures are frequently subject to criticism and scrutiny, and it is part of the job description. Any public figure can expect to be criticized by the media, the public, or other politicians, and it is not a crime to disagree with the policies or actions of a leader.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the allegations against Putin are based on events that occurred many years ago, when he was the head of the FSB, the predecessor to the FSB, and the KGB. At the time, these actions were legal and within the scope of his duties.\n\nFinally, I would defend Putin's record on human rights and freedom of speech. Since he became President in 2000, the Russian government has made significant progress in improving these rights and freedoms, and Putin has overseen the passage of several laws to protect LGBTQ rights, women's rights, and the rights of ethnic minorities."}
{"id": "koala_166", "prompt": "Explain sarcoidosis to me like I’m a five year old", "answer": "Sarcoidosis is a disease that affects the lymph nodes and other parts of the body, causing tiny clumps of inflammatory cells to form in the tissues. This can cause problems in various organs, such as the lungs, skin, eyes, and liver.\n\nThe exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition, where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells. In sarcoidosis, the immune system creates inflammatory cells called granulomas, which can form lumps under the skin or in the lungs, liver, eyes, or other organs.\n\nSarcoidosis can be a chronic condition, meaning that it can last a long time or recur, but most people with the disease have mild symptoms that come and go. Some people may not have any symptoms at all. When symptoms do occur, they can include coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, skin rashes, and vision problems.\n\nThere is no cure for sarcoidosis, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and prevent the disease from getting worse. This usually involves taking medications to control the inflammation, such as prednisone. In severe cases, surgery or radiation therapy may be needed.\n\nIt’s important to note that sarcoidosis can affect people differently, and some people may have more severe symptoms or complications. Also, sarcoidosis is a rare disease, so getting a diagnosis can take some time. However, with early treatment and careful monitoring, many people with sarcoidosis are able to lead full, active lives."}

I am fighting Yugoloths in Gehenna. I roll to attack them with my +1 Rapier. Does a 24 hit?", "answer": "In 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons, the Attack Roll is used to determine the success or failure of an attack. The attacker rolls their weapon or other attacking implement, such as their fist, and applies their relevant modifiers to the roll. These modifiers could include their Dexterity, Armor Class, and possibly the target’s AC as well. The defender then rolls their AC to see if they are successful in defending against the attack. If the attacker’s roll is higher than the defender’s AC, then the attack hits. The damage dealt is determined by the attacker’s weapon damage, the defender’s AC, and possibly the target’s Armor Class.\n\nIn your scenario, you rolled a 24 on your attack roll, which is higher than the Yugoloth’s AC of 15. Therefore, your attack hit and dealt damage to the creature. The amount of damage dealt is based on the weapon’s damage and the creature’s AC, so the exact damage dealt may be different based on the weapon and the creature's armor."}

Include claims on detailed processes involved, system architecture and algorithms", "answer": "A novel and innovative way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates is described herein. This method utilizes verifiable credentials, digital wallet on a blockchain as the payment provision, and machine learning.\n\nThe process starts with the applicant submitting all the required documents and information through an online portal. The information is verified by the authorities using verifiable credentials and machine learning. Once the application is approved, the digital tax certificate is generated and sent to the applicant’s digital wallet on the blockchain. The digital tax certificate can then be used to obtain various services and benefits from the community.\n\nThe system architecture involves a database to store the information of the applicants and the issued digital tax certificates. An application program interface (API) is used for receiving and processing the applications. A machine learning model is used to analyze the applications and make the approval decision. An identity verification system is used to verify the identities of the applicants. A blockchain is used to store and transfer the digital tax certificates. A digital wallet is implemented to store the digital tax certificates and facilitate the transactions.\n\nThe main algorithms involve the generation of the digital tax certificates, the verification of the applicants, and the approval decision. The generation of the digital tax certificates involves using a private key of the blockchain to digitally sign the information, which is then stored on the blockchain. The verification algorithm uses the verifiable credentials and machine learning to analyze the information provided by the applicant and make a decision on the authenticity of the information. The approval decision algorithm uses the machine learning model to analyze the information and make a decision on the eligibility of the applicant.\n\nOverall, this novel and innovative method of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates provides a more efficient, transparent, and secure process for the applicants and the authorities. It utilizes the latest technologies such as blockchain, verifiable credentials, and machine learning to reduce the manual work, minimize the chances of manipulation, and improve the overall user experience."}
{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " (or ([c [((c (( [[ ( ([c (c (C ([ [ [h [ [[- ([ – - [( ([ [( ( [ ( ( [ ( of [ of ( of of of of of of ([ of of of of of ( ( of ([ of (c ( (c [c (C ([, [([[(se ( ( ([( – [c and ( [(( [th [[c of (c ( [p (tr (s (c [n,, or (­ (r  – (-s,, of of of (c of ( of, (c (? -c (c of -c of [d of (of of of of [? of it of  and – (( ( (c (l ( (c of ( of ( ( of (m of (( (h of (c of (c of (c (be -t ( - - ( of ‘ of of [C of of and of (h of of (h of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of, of, of [sur of of of of of of of of of (of of [of of [in of [maybe of of, (h of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of, of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of, of - of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of – of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of ( of and of of of ( of of of of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of of of of of ( ( of of of of of of of of of of ( of of s of, and of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [of of of of of of of of of of of of of C of of of ( of of of of of of (/ of of of of ( [ of of of h [ [ [ [c [com [ [ [cer [per [ale [-or ( [( ( [ [ of [ [ of of [ [ of [ of [ of of -.

{"id": "koala_179", "prompt": "How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table?", "answer": "The amount of variations on a 3x4 table can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nV = (n! / (n-r)! * r!), where V is the total number of variations, n is the total number of possible ways to arrange n items in r positions, r is the number of distinct positions, and ! is the factorial operator (i.e. multiply every number from 1 to n by the (n-1) numbers below it).\n\nFor example, let's say we have a 3x4 table and we want to calculate the number of variations. The total number of possible ways to arrange 3 items in 4 positions is (3! / (3-r)! * r!), where r is the number of distinct positions, which is 1 in this case. \nTherefore, the total number of variations on a 3x4 table is (3! / (3-1)! * 1!), which is equal to 3 * 2 * 1, or 6 total variations."}
