{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banks can use cash as a buffer for potential losses, but they need to follow the rules to be able to do that. The reason why it is important for banks to have enough capital to cover their potential losses is to protect their depositors' funds. \n\nIf cash is used as capital, it is considered a liquid asset and can be easily converted into cash. This is important because it means that the bank can quickly withdraw the cash if they need to and be able to meet their obligations with their depositors. However, using cash as capital has its own disadvantages, such as:\n\n1. It hinders the bank's ability to take advantage of investment opportunities because the bank cannot invest the cash.\n\n2. It limits the bank's ability to lend because the bank only has limited cash to lend out.\n\n3. It ties up the cash, which means the bank cannot use it to make money. \n\nFor these reasons, it is usually not advisable for banks to use cash as capital, especially in large amounts. Banks should have at least a certain amount of capital to cover their potential losses, and the amount can vary depending on the size and risk of the bank.\n\nAs for the question about why banks are not allowed to use cash as capital, it is because using cash as capital does not fully meet the requirements of capital as a buffer for potential losses.\n\nCapital is intended to protect depositors' funds, so it should be permanent and cannot be withdrawn easily. Using cash as capital can be easily withdrawn, which means that the bank's capital is not permanent.\n\nCapital should be readily available, so the bank should have enough liquid assets to quickly withdraw if they need to. Using cash as capital ties up the cash, which means that the bank does not have readily available cash to withdraw.\n\nCapital should be high enough to cover potential losses, so it should be at least enough to cover the losses of the bank. Using cash as capital does not necessarily cover all the losses, so it is not enough to be considered as capital.\n\nFor these reasons, using cash as capital is not allowed, as it does not meet the requirements of capital as a buffer for potential losses."}

{"id": "koala_6", "prompt": "Can you tell my a story about nuclear physics like dr Seuss?", "answer": "In the beginning there was nothing. Then, there was a Big Bang, and suddenly there was everything: light, dark, matter, and antimatter. \n\nAs the universe expanded and cooled, the elements were created: hydrogen, helium, and lithium. \n\nThe universe contained so much energy that some of it was converted into matter and antimatter. When the antimatter and matter came into contact, they annihilated each other in a flash of light. \n\nHowever, some matter and antimatter were created at slightly different angles, and they did not meet. Instead of annihilating, they recombined to form new elements. The process of creating new elements through the fusion of matter and antimatter is called nuclear fusion. \n\nAlmost all of the matter in the universe is made up of different combinations of hydrogen, helium, and lithium. The only elements that are created through nuclear fusion are helium and heavier elements. The process of creating heavier elements is called nuclear fusion. \n\nIn the core of a star, the temperature and pressure are high enough to fuse hydrogen into helium. As the star continues to burn, it uses up all of its hydrogen, and it begins to fuse helium into carbon. \n\nAs the star continues to burn, it uses up all of its helium and begins to fuse carbon into oxygen. \n\nThe carbon and oxygen from the core of the star are transported to the outer layers, where they are fused into progressively heavier elements such as magnesium, silicon, sulfur, and iron. \n\nAs the star continues to burn, it uses up all of its fuel and becomes unstable. It explodes in a supernova, blasting its outer layers into space. \n\nThe material from the supernova cools and starts to contract under its own gravity. After a few million years, it becomes a neutron star, which is extremely dense and incredibly hot. \n\nThe neutron star continues to cool and contract, until it becomes a black hole, which is even more dense and hot than a neutron star. \n\nInside the black hole, the temperature and pressure are so high that the electrons and protons in the atoms are squeezed together to form neutrons. \n\nThe material from the supernova continues to fall into the black hole, and it gets compressed even further. Eventually, the electrons and protons in the atoms are squeezed together to form neutrons. \n\nThe neutrons form a dense, hot, and dense core, called the neutron star. \n\nEven though the neutron star is extremely dense and hot, it has an extremely small size. It is about the size of a city, but it is so dense that it has a mass of about 1.4 million tons. \n\nThe neutron star continues to spin, emitting radiation and powerful magnetic fields. \n\nEventually, the neutron star cools and loses its rotation. It becomes a pulsar, which is a rotating neutron star that emits pulses of radiation. \n\nThe pulsar spins hundreds of times per second, sending pulses of radiation out into space. \n\nOver time, the pulsar loses energy and cools, until it becomes a white dwarf. \n\nA white dwarf is the remnant of a star that has run out of fuel and has shrunk to a very small size. A white dwarf is a dense star that is about the size of the Earth, but it is extremely dense and heavy. \n\nA white dwarf cools over time, until it no longer emits any radiation. However, it continues to lose energy through radiation, and it contracts under its own gravity. \n\nOver time, the white dwarf becomes more and more dense, until it reaches a critical point where it cannot become any denser. At this point, the white dwarf explodes in a supernova, and the material from the explosion is blasted into space. \n\nThe explosion of a white dwarf is one of the most powerful explosions in the universe, and it can expel material outwards with a velocity of millions of miles per hour. \n\nThe material from the explosion forms a shell of gas and dust around the white dwarf, which can form a nebula. \n\nIf the nebula is not destroyed by the supernova explosion, it can form a planetary system around the white dwarf, which contains planets and possibly life. \n\nThe process of creating new elements through nuclear fusion"}

This results in a self-contained, turn-key, fully functional automation solution that can be deployed quickly, with minimal effort and resources.\n\nThe architecture employs an \"event-driven\" approach, where the system is always \"on\", constantly monitoring the environment for events, and responding to them in real-time. When an event is detected, the system determines the appropriate \"choreography\" to execute, and executes it. The results of the execution are stored in the system, and the system waits for the next event. This continuous cycle of event detection, choreography execution, and result storage, allows the system to maintain a current, up-to-date, consistent view of the process. The system also allows for multiple execution instances of the same process, allowing for parallel execution, load balancing, or scaling of the process to handle increased demand.\n\nThe system uses a \"service-oriented\" architecture, where the components are loosely coupled and can communicate with other components using standard protocols such as HTTP, XML-RPC, or JMS. This allows the system to be easily integrated with other systems, and to communicate with them in a standard, message-based way.\n\nThe system uses a flexible \"adaptive\" architecture, where components can be added, removed, or reconfigured to adapt to changing business requirements or needs. This allows the system to scale, and to be easily adapted and customized to meet the needs of the organization.\n\nThe system uses a \"distributed\" architecture, where the components are located in a distributed, multi-tier environment, allowing for ease of deployment, load balancing, and high-availability.\n\nThe system uses a \"secure\" architecture, with strong authentication and authorization to protect the data and the system from unauthorized access.\n\nThe system uses a \"reliable\" architecture, with the ability to detect and handle network failures, node failures, and other types of faults, and to recover from them.\n\nThe system uses a \"scalable\" architecture, allowing for easy and incremental expansion of the system to meet the needs of the organization.\n\nThe system uses a \"modular\" architecture, where the components can be easily reused and combined to create new composite choreographies and process automations.\n\nThe system uses a \"portable\" architecture, where the components can be deployed on multiple platforms, allowing for easy deployment and support of a wide range of operating systems and hardware.\n\nThe system uses a \"real-time\" architecture, allowing for real-time, instantaneous execution of the process automation.\n\nThe system uses a \"multi-tenant\" architecture, allowing for multiple, independent process automations to coexist, and to share resources such as databases and services. This allows the system to scale, and to be used by multiple organizations or business units.\n\nThe system uses a \"service-oriented\" architecture, where the components can be managed, monitored, and controlled using the standard management tools and protocols.\n\nThe system uses a \"distributed\" architecture, where the components are loosely coupled and can communicate with each other using standard protocols such as HTTP, XML-RPC, or JMS. This allows the system to be easily integrated with other systems, and to communicate with them in a standard, message-based way.\n\nThe system uses a \"secure\" architecture, with strong authentication and authorization to protect the data and the system from unauthorized access.\n\nThe system uses a \"reliable\" architecture, with the ability to detect and handle network failures,"}

This is done to determine the amount of energy stored in the food, which is measured in kilocalories (kCal).\n\nAs you can see, the caloric value of carbohydrates, proteins and fats is the same, which is 4 kCal per gram. This is because all three macronutrients provide the body with energy in the form of glucose, and glucose is the main source of energy for the body.\n\nOn the other hand, the caloric value of vitamins, minerals and electrolytes is undefined. This is because they do not provide energy and therefore cannot be measured in calories. However, it is important to note that these nutrients are essential for the proper functioning of the body, and therefore, should be consumed in adequate amounts."}

{"id": "koala_25", "prompt": "Write me a 2000 word essay on a water safety engineering project.", "answer": "Water Safety Engineering (WSE) is a multidisciplinary field of engineering that aims to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from water-related accidents. WSE involves the application of scientific and engineering principles to the design, construction, and maintenance of water-related structures and systems, in order to ensure their safety and reliability.\n\nA WSE project could be designing a barrier to prevent drowning, or improving the safety of a swimming pool, water park, or aquatic facility. It could also involve developing new technologies for water rescue, or carrying out research on risk assessment and management.\n\nThe first step in any WSE project is to identify the potential hazards, and assess the level of risk associated with them. This involves identifying the people at risk, determining the likelihood of an accident occurring, and assessing the consequences of such an event. The risk assessment should be carried out by a qualified professional, ideally with expertise in the relevant water activity.\n\nThe next step is to identify control measures to reduce the risk. These could include the installation of barriers, the provision of safety equipment, or the development of emergency procedures. The measures should be proportionate to the risk, and aimed at eliminating or reducing the likelihood of an accident.\n\nThe effectiveness of the control measures should be assessed through monitoring and evaluation. This involves regularly inspecting the barriers or safety equipment, and conducting tests to ensure they are working properly. The results of the monitoring can be used to modify the controls as necessary, or to demonstrate their effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, the main steps involved in a WSE project are:\n\n1. Identify the hazards and assess the risk\n\n2. Identify control measures to reduce the risk\n\n3. Implement the control measures\n\n4. Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures\n\n5. Modify the controls as necessary, or demonstrate their effectiveness\n\n6. Maintain the controls to ensure they remain effective\n\nWhen designing a WSE project, it is important to consider the impact of the proposed measures on the people who use the water activity. The controls should be designed to be practical and easy to use, and to minimise the disruption to the activity. It is also important to consider the wider impact of the project, such as any environmental or social impacts.\n\nA WSE project can take a long time to complete, and it requires close collaboration between different disciplines. It is important to involve the relevant experts and stakeholders throughout the project, and to communicate effectively with them.\n\nIn summary, a WSE project involves the application of scientific and engineering principles to reduce the risk of water-related accidents. It involves identifying the hazards and risk, and implementing control measures to reduce the risk. The effectiveness of the control measures is monitored, and the controls are modified or improved as necessary. The project is undertaken in close consultation with the relevant experts and stakeholders, and the wider impacts of the project are considered."}

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "Overall, segmentation AP is affected by numerous factors, including the segmentation model, the number of classes, the input image resolution, and the input image quality.\n\nFor the segmentation model, the choice of architecture and type of loss can affect the performance of instance segmentation. For example, ResNet-based architectures tend to achieve better performance on instance segmentation than VGG-based architectures. The choice of loss function can also affect the performance of instance segmentation. For instance, using cross-entropy loss with instance weighting (e.g., focal loss) or mean squared error loss can improve segmentation AP compared to using cross-entropy loss without instance weighting.\n\nFor the number of classes, larger number of classes can increase the difficulty of instance segmentation, resulting in lower segmentation AP.\n\nFor the input image resolution, lower resolution can reduce the spatial information in the input image, resulting in lower segmentation AP.\n\nFor the input image quality, lower image quality can increase the difficulty of instance segmentation, resulting in lower segmentation AP.\n\nOverall, improving the segmentation model, reducing the number of classes, increasing the input image resolution, and increasing the image quality can help improve the segmentation AP. Additionally, using appropriate loss functions and data augmentation techniques can also improve segmentation AP."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": "[st and. and in (w in and and and more and t, al, and and in and. and and and (t and in in st, and or, and w�c or of \"h in c [re (c (st to to to 4 to 1 to to and, and and of the of of of of of.. of in and in (t and,, and [reg and and of (p of of of of of of of, of ((supp and and and,[to s in, to [p,, and and st, and, and,, and [p and. in (st [in, ,h. 1..,,.h, ((f, <ch ((co in co 2 n. to �[c to as [my as [and [and as [my in my and of my that and by [m in in in in and in and w and in s-my that.[that in. and at and and and, and.

A boy and girl can be best friends without ever developing romantic feelings for each other. Having a close friendship with someone of the opposite sex can be a healthy and positive thing. However, it's important to recognize the limitations of such a relationship. For example, when people are in a romantic relationship, they are able to speak honestly and openly with each other. They can share their deepest thoughts and feelings with one another and know that they will be accepted and understood.\n\nWhen you're just friends with someone of the opposite sex, you're not able to have this type of intimacy. Therefore, it can be difficult to share your true feelings and emotions. Another limitation of a platonic relationship is the possibility that one or both people may develop romantic feelings for each other over time.

{"id": "koala_42", "prompt": "Do you know something about the book  ＂the art of thinking clearly\" wrote by Rolf Dobelli?", "answer": "Yes, here is an excerpt from the book:\n\n\"The human brain is the most complex object in the known universe. It generates more knowledge, more ideas and more innovations than any other machine or device known to man. Yet, it is also the most error-prone object in the known universe. It makes mistakes, it overlooks things, it misinterprets, it confuses, it generalizes, it simplifies, it exaggerates, it hallucinates, it deceives. And it does all this with unerring reliability.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: the brain is designed to save energy, not to think clearly. It evolved to help us survive in a hostile world, not to make us smart. Its primary goal is to keep us safe. And that means it's constantly on the lookout for dangers, whether real or imagined. It's always trying to predict what might happen next, and it does this by creating mental shortcuts, by making assumptions and by drawing conclusions.\n\nThis is a useful and efficient way to operate. It helped our ancestors to survive. But it can also lead to errors and cognitive biases. The brain is like a powerful and efficient machine, but it's not perfect. And that's why we need to understand its weaknesses and learn to think clearly, so that we can avoid its mistakes and overcome its blind spots.\n\nIn this book, I'll show you how to do exactly that. I'll share with you my best strategies and insights for thinking clearly and making better decisions. And I'll give you a variety of simple tools and techniques that you can use to overcome your cognitive biases, avoid common thinking traps and think more rationally.\n\nSo if you want to learn how to think clearly, read on.\n\n1. **Know your cognitive biases:** The first step is to become aware of your biases. There are many different types, and they affect us in different ways. Some cause us to make bad decisions, while others cause us to make good ones too quickly. Some make us overconfident, while others make us too cautious. Some make us trust others, while others make us distrust them. Some make us too conservative, while others make us too risky. Some make us lazy, while others make us work too hard. And some make us optimistic, while others make us pessimistic.\n\nThe important thing is to know which biases affect you, and how they affect your decisions and behavior. Once you know this, you can start to mitigate their effects.\n\n2. **Use the right tools and techniques:** Once you know your biases, you can use different tools and techniques to counter them. For example, you can use the two-minute rule or the 10/10/10 rule to overcome your impulsiveness. You can use the availability heuristic to counteract your overconfidence. You can use the rule of thumb or the anchoring bias to avoid making bad decisions. You can use the confirmation bias to find and trust credible sources of information. You can use the availability heuristic, the representativeness heuristic or the hindsight bias to avoid being overly optimistic or pessimistic. You can use the bandwagon effect to improve your persuasiveness. You can use the hindsight bias or the rationalization bias to overcome your laziness. You can use the hindsight bias, the wishful thinking bias or the optimism bias to become more optimistic. You can use the confirmation bias, the hindsight bias or the sunk cost bias to become more conservative or risk-averse. You can use the confirmation bias, the hindsight bias or the sunk cost bias to become more lazy or work harder. And you can use the availability heuristic, the anchoring bias or the bandwagon effect to become more trusting or cautious of others.\n\nThese are just a few examples. There are many other tools and techniques that you can use to counter your biases, and the ones I've mentioned here are just a small selection. The important thing is to know which tools and techniques work best for you, and to use them appropriately.\n\n3. **Avoid cognitive distortions:** Another important step is to avoid cognitive distortions. These are mistakes in our thinking, such as exaggeration, overgeneralization and filter bias. They cause us to think in an unrealistic or biased way, and they often lead to poor decisions and poor outcomes.\n\nTo avoid cognitive distortions, it's"}

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

Here are some additional things you can do to protect yourself and your account.\n\n1. Enable 2FA: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is the most important thing you can do to secure your Reddit account. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to enter a code from your phone or a physical security key when logging in. This is especially important for high-value accounts or accounts with sensitive information. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help.\n\n2. Use strong, unique passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. It’s also a good idea to update your password every couple of months, or when you notice suspicious activity such as multiple failed login attempts.\n\n3. Use a password manager: A password manager is a great tool to securely store and manage all your passwords, and provides an extra layer of security by generating and remembering strong, unique passwords for you. It also provides features like password autofill, which makes logging into websites much easier and safer.\n\n4. Be careful on public wifi: Using public wifi can leave your account exposed to potential attacks. Whenever possible, we recommend using a secure and trusted connection such as your home or work Wi-Fi.\n\n5. Monitor your account: Keep an eye on your account for any suspicious activity by checking your recent activity and the account’s activity page regularly. If you see something unusual, change your password immediately and contact Reddit Support.\n\n6. Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity, report it to Reddit Support right away.\n\nThanks for the question! We hope this helps."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " 10 andual. 1."}

At the most recent time of a moonrise, the moon is going to cover the next point to the north. How far north will it be?", "answer": "When the moon rises, it will cover the next point north of where it was at the last time of a moonrise.\n\nThe moon orbits the Earth in an elliptical path with one side (called the near side) always facing the Earth, and the other side (called the far side) always facing away.\n\nAt any one time, the moon is \"above\" or \"below\" the horizon, depending on its position relative to the observer. When the moon is above the horizon, it is visible. When the moon is below the horizon, it is not visible.\n\nA full moon occurs when the moon is located directly opposite the Earth from the sun, and it is visible all across the Earth. At the moment of a full moon, the moon is in the same position relative to the Earth as it was at the last full moon. This means that the next point north of where the moon was at the last full moon is the next point above the horizon, where it will be visible.\n\nTo find the distance north, we can use the equation of a circle:\n\nwhere:\n\n* d = distance from the center to the point on the circle\n* r = radius of the circle\n* θ = angle from the center\n\nIn this case, the center is the sun, the radius is the distance of the moon from the Earth, and the angle is the angle between the line from the center to the moon and the line from the center to the Earth.\n\nSubstituting values we get:\n\nwhere:\n\n* d = 6371 km, the distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the moon\n* r = 384,400 km, the radius of the moon's orbit\n* θ = 87.3°, the angle between the line from the center to the moon and the line from the center to the Earth\n\nUsing these values, we get:\n\nwhere:\n\n* d = 6371 km\n* r = 384,400 km\n* θ = 87.3°\n\nTherefore, the next point north of where the moon was at the last full moon is 6371 km north of the center of the Earth, which is about 6700 km north of the North Pole."}

His family had lived in the area since ancient times, and they were respected and respectable members of their community. However, there was a dark secret in the family, one that was unknown to my character and his siblings.\n\nIn the year 1500, a group of dark creatures had invaded the town and set up a stronghold in the forests surrounding it. They had killed the human settlers and enslaved the half-elves, who were forced to work in the mines and serve their masters. The members of my character's family refused to join the dark cult and were persecuted for their refusal. The half-elves were tortured to force them to worship the creatures, and their bodies were mutilated for ritualistic purposes. Eventually, many of them died.\n\nMy character was one of the few survivors. He was only a young boy at the time, and he was forced to watch his family being slaughtered before his eyes. He managed to escape and fled into the forest, where he lived as a wild animal for many years. His wounds healed, and he learned how to hunt, forage, and survive in the wilderness. He developed a deep connection with the natural world, and he vowed to one day exact vengeance on the creatures that had killed his family.\n\nWhen he was older, he returned to the town and discovered that the dark creatures had long since left. However, the half-elves who had lived in the town were still enslaved, and they had been forced to live as second-class citizens. My character went back into the forest, and he gathered a group of like-minded adventurers to free the half-elves. They raided the stronghold and liberated the prisoners, and they drove the dark creatures out of the town. My character and his companions became heroes, and they were revered for their bravery and determination.\n\nMy character now lives in the town, where he is a respected and revered member of the community.

{"id": "koala_58", "prompt": "which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions", "answer": "The second messenger molecule that acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions is calcium-release activated calcium (CRAC) channel, also known as STIM1-OSCP channel. STIM1 is a type of intracellular calcium sensor, which senses intracellular calcium ions and activates the CRAC channel. When intracellular calcium ions increase, STIM1 binds to the CRAC channel, activating it and allowing calcium ions to flow out of the cell. This release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum in turn activates other proteins, triggering the cellular response, such as muscle contraction."}

I've been working hard to track down the last of the Jedi rebels.\"\n\n\"Good work, Anakin. I'm sure the Emperor appreciates it. Now, would you care for a cup of tea?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Master Vader. That would be lovely.\"\n\nLord Vader poured two cups of tea, and the two Jedi sat down to enjoy a leisurely chat. They discussed the political situation in the galaxy, and how the Emperor was making the galaxy a better place for everyone. Anakin found himself agreeing with everything Lord Vader said, and he began to feel a little uncomfortable.\n\n\"I must say, Master Vader, the Emperor is an inspiration to us all,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you approve, Anakin,\" said Lord Vader. \"Now, tell me...have you ever heard of the Clone Wars?\"\n\n\"The Clone Wars? No, Master Vader, I'm afraid I haven't.\"\n\n\"Well, they were a series of battles fought between the Republic and the Separatists, and they were a real hardship for the Republic. The Clone Troopers were very loyal, but they weren't very bright. They were easy to trick and bribe. Eventually, the Republic lost the war, and the Separatists took over the galaxy. The Republic was reduced to a few small, weak planets, and the Separatists became the Dark Side. It was a dark time for the galaxy, and it could have continued if it wasn't for a young Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi.\"\n\n\"Obi-Wan Kenobi? I've heard that name before. He's the Jedi who fought and defeated the Sith Lord Darth Vader, right?\"\n\n\"That's right, Anakin,\" said Lord Vader. \"Obi-Wan was a great Jedi, but he was no match for me. I killed him in a duel on Mustafar.\"\n\n\"Mustafar?\" Anakin's eyes widened. \"I've never heard of that planet before.\"\n\n\"That's because it's a volcanic world. The lava was scalding hot, and Obi-Wan's lightsaber was unable to cut through it.\"\n\nAnakin was shocked. \"You killed Obi-Wan? But...but he was a Jedi, a good man. He saved me from the lava on Geonosis. How could you do such a thing?\"\n\n\"I had no choice, Anakin,\" said Lord Vader. \"I had to stop Obi-Wan.

Why would you do something like that?\"\n\n\"I'm not a hero, Anakin. I'm a Sith Lord, and I have a long history of bloodshed and violence. I have no qualms about killing, and I will stop at nothing to further the Empire's interests.\"\n\nAnakin's face went pale. \"You...you're a monster...you're not the good guy at all.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I must disagree, Anakin,\" said Lord Vader. \"I am a force for good, a leader who brings order to the galaxy.

{"id": "koala_73", "prompt": "How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from?", "answer": "The simplest way to think about this is that money from your pocket goes to the stock market, where it is invested in stocks and bonds. When investors buy stocks, they are actually purchasing shares in the company, and the company gets the money. The company can then use that money to fund its operations, grow the business, and pay its employees.\n\nOver time, the stock price of the company you purchased can go up or down, depending on how the business is performing. When your stock price goes up, you make a profit, and you can sell the stock to get your money back. If you decide to hold onto the stock, you can continue to earn dividends over time, which is money paid out by the company to its shareholders.\n\nWhen you sell the stock, the money goes back to the stock market, where it can be used to invest in other companies or to fund new businesses.\n\nIn summary, money goes from your pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business you've bought stock from by providing capital to fund its operations, grow the business, and pay employees."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " and, ((t, d, and, [d, and, [t, -f and, (d, (of, (h of the of w of of the of the of of the of of of the of of of of of of of (contr of the of of of (ex of of (se of a (h (pr of [for (c (b (h ([supp (h [or (p in the ((s [[C (p (gener, [H, [p, and, for (s, and, [of, and, and [[[m, [(and, (d (m, (and and, and, –ink, and, and of, of, of, of the of, or, of, and, (s, and, and of, of, (main, [pro, and, --p, and, c, -in, tim, and, [per, (inf (d, of of their of of of of, of a of of, of of, of (of of of (of of of of [of [F, ([p of a of of [of (cou of, [center of [dis of [[p (I, of (b [co, -in of [(ho (([C [I, [s, [d of [w:g (subject, (-s (about (h:([d [p of [[(of of [[(of [H of [du (([d of [(N ([you, [cont, (([[or (or (l, l of, (of (–(th, the the (h (in (C [C, the [de, [d-part and, (p (of, (int, (the and,[t, (re, [in, (d of (of (and ((you ([for (and, and, of, (for, of of (f, of (C of (p (con, (C (b [h (c ([le, or, of (of (of of (and (b of (f (((part (c (f, (h ([([of ((f, [-of ((of ((or of (of of of of of, of ((of of of of, of both, -•, (t,—h: and ([((in,, (of, of, and, (d of, of (c (with, (in of (of of, of the [line (of, –co, they –c, (d, (he, (spe, of sp (cont (of (dis, ro [and (po and, [for (b, (de of, of of of the of of “of of [p and, [of (of (of, (sp of, of of of (of of (of,,, of,, of, of their, and, (con (d, (information (con of, of of of (of of of of c,, l of, of of the of the of, of the of about of about of about of the of of about of of the, (subject, (for, and, and,, or of, of,, or, (of, (m,, [[part, in, in the of (of of of of of (of of of of (d,, ([of,, (p,, (((-about,, (s,, (in,, of,, of, of, ((dis, of, and, of, of (of, of, of, (d, of, of of of, of (of of, of, of of, of, s, or,,, or, (b,, (d, of (vis,, [t [of (of of of of of of of the (of of, of, of of of of of of (of of of ((of of ((F of: of (B (L,, (H,, ((of (f (of of of (of of (of of of of of of of of of,, of, of, of, of of of of of of of of of, of,, - of, of of, of,, (and, (, (of of of of of of of of – of of of of of (F of, of, of (w, of, of, of, of of, of of of of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, —, of (e, of, (P of [\" of of ( of of of of of of of of of, of, of"}

During the mashing process, the malted barley is steeped in hot water to extract the sugars. While the mash is being heated, hops are added to the brew kettle to prevent wild microorganisms from growing.\n\n2. During the boil, hops are added to the brew kettle to extract their flavor and aroma. During this stage, the temperature of the wort is increased, which helps to break down the hop resins and release the bittering components.\n\n3. After the boil, the wort is cooled to a temperature where yeast can be added to start the fermentation process. At this point, more hops can be added to the wort for flavor and aroma, known as dry-hopping. The hops are added to the fermentation vessel for a short period of time, typically overnight or for a few days.\n\n4. After the beer has fermented, it is conditioned on the yeast for several weeks to develop the desired flavors and carbonation.

This would require special equipment, such as a helicopter or a heavy cargo vehicle, since the crane is too large to fit in a standard transport vehicle.\n\nOnce the crane is on site, it would need to be set up. This would take time, since the crane must be properly leveled and stabilized, and its jib and counterweight would need to be positioned. Because the crane is so large, it would need to be anchored to the ground using heavy-duty guy wires, or it could be set up on a temporary foundation, such as piles or concrete.\n\nOnce the crane is set up, it would need to be operated by a qualified and experienced crane operator. This would require a large crew, since the crane would need to be positioned and moved while being careful to avoid damage to the mountain, or to other structures or equipment in the area.\n\nFinally, the crane would need to lift the mountain. This would require significant effort, since Mount Everest is very massive, and would need to be moved a significant distance. It would take a long time to raise the mountain, and it would need to be lowered carefully to avoid damage or dislodging any loose material.\n\nIn summary, while a Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 crane could hypothetically lift Mount Everest, it would require a significant amount of preparation and resources, and it would be a very challenging task."}

In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

The angle between the Earth and the sun is 90 degrees, so:\n\n```distance = √[(1500000000^2) + (1500000000^2)]\ndistance = 1495978720\ndistance = 1059360000\ndistance = 1059360000 km\n```\n\nThe length of a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, and blocks the sun's light. The duration of the eclipse depends on several factors, such as the distance of the moon from the Earth, the angle of the moon's orbit, and the speed of the moon's orbit. For this specific eclipse, the moon will be at a distance of about 406200 km from the Earth, and will take approximately 5 hours and 14 minutes to cross the face of the sun."}

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "Krishnamurti's teaching was based on a deep insight into the nature of the human mind. His point of departure was that the root of our personal and collective problems lies in our mistaken belief that we are separate beings, with a separate self or ego, who are in competition with each other for various desirable things such as love, recognition, material wealth, etc.\n\nIn aikido, as in other arts, we learn how to use our body to do certain things, such as throwing, grabbing, striking, etc. This is taught through formal exercises, and through doing and practicing the techniques we gain certain skills and abilities. But Krishnamurti would say that this is only part of the picture. The other, more important part, is to understand the relationship between the \"doer\" and the \"doing\".\n\nIn aikido, this means learning to let go of our judgements, desires, and preconceptions, and to be totally present in the moment, with a non-judgemental, open and compassionate mind. This does not mean that you should not have strong intent or commitment in the practice, but it means that you should learn to let go of your attachment to the outcome of the technique, and to trust in the process.\n\nIn summary, the principles of aikido can be used as a framework for developing a mindfulness practice, and this can make aikido training into a deeply transformative and spiritual experience.\n\nI hope this helps. If you are interested in this topic, I would recommend reading Krishnamurti's books and watching some of his videos."}

First and foremost, documenting history is important because it allows people to learn from the past and avoid making the same mistakes. For example, a historical document may mention a war that was fought a hundred years ago, and it may contain information about the reasons why the war was fought or the strategies used by the opposing armies. People can learn from this document, and they may use it to develop a better understanding of the causes of conflict or to come up with new strategies for waging war.\n\nAnother reason why documenting history is important is because it helps people to understand their place in the world and their connection with the people and events that came before them. For instance, a historical document may contain information about the lives of people from a particular time and place, and it may provide a glimpse into the challenges they faced or the things they valued. By reading this document, people can gain a deeper understanding of their own history and culture, and they may develop a greater sense of pride and belonging.\n\nFinally, documenting history is important because it helps to preserve our cultural heritage and prevent it from being lost forever. For example, a historical document may contain information about the customs and traditions of a particular community, and it may provide valuable insight into the ways in which people used to live. By preserving this information, we can ensure that future generations will be able to learn about their past and keep their history alive.\n\nIn summary, documenting history is important because it allows us to learn from the past, understand our place in the world, and preserve our cultural heritage. By preserving our history, we can ensure that future generations will be able to learn from the past and avoid making the same mistakes."}

{"id": "koala_133", "prompt": "Why did the building of a pipeline have to be voted on by the government(USA)? Doesn't this infringe on government interfering with private corporations?<br>", "answer": "The building of a pipeline is a complex and expensive undertaking, and it is natural to have concerns about the financial viability of such a project. The government, as the regulator of the oil and gas industry, is responsible for ensuring that the project is financially viable and that the risks are appropriately managed. In order to do so, it may need to approve or reject the proposed project, or approve it with certain conditions.\n\nIn the case of the Keystone XL pipeline, the proposed project was required to be approved by the U.S. government, as it crossed the international border between the United States and Canada, and would be used to transport crude oil from the oil sands in Alberta, Canada, to refineries in the U.S.\n\nThe government's role in approving or rejecting the project was based on determining whether the project was in the national interest. This required the government to consider various factors, including the economic benefits, potential environmental impacts, and the safety of the pipeline.\n\nOverall, the government determined that the project was not in the national interest, and the pipeline was not approved.\n\nIn summary, government approval of the pipeline was necessary because it was a complex and expensive project that required the government to consider various factors and ensure that the project was in the national interest."}

The virtualization software is now represented with the term hypervisor. Hardware virtualization is used to share the resources of the cloud providers effectively with the customers by generating an illusion of dedicated computing, storage, and networking on a computing infrastructure.<br><br>The concept of virtualization is physically implemented using the hypervisor modules, and the operation and processing of hypervisors are materialized by the OSS. In other words, hypervisor modules are installed on top of OSS, which act as an interface between hardware units and hypervisor packages.\"", "answer": "In simple terms, virtualization is a process of creating a virtual (or artificial) version of something, rather than the real thing. In the context of cloud computing, virtualization is used to create virtual machines (VMs) that emulate real computers, complete with an operating system and hardware. The VMs are hosted on a cloud infrastructure, where they share the physical resources of the cloud with other customers.\n\nA basic function of VM software is to create a virtual environment that is complete with its own set of resources, such as the operating system and hardware. This is done by isolating the VM from the underlying hardware, creating a layer of abstraction between the two. This separation of the VM from the hardware allows the VM to run independently, even if the host hardware crashes or is rebooted. The VM is also able to access the resources of the host computer, such as the network, while keeping the host and VMs isolated from each other.\n\nAnother important function of VM software is to enable multiple VMs to run on the same computer at the same time, while each VM is able to use its own resources. This is done using virtualization technology that allocates resources to the VMs on a need basis.\n\nThe hypervisor is a small piece of software that manages the virtualization of the computer hardware. It is responsible for creating and managing virtual machines. In addition, it handles communication between the VM and the host computer, and provides access to the underlying hardware. The hypervisor can be installed on top of the operating system or directly on the hardware.\n\nVirtualization software, such as VMware, Xen, KVM, and Microsoft Hyper-V, are the commercial products that provide the functionality of the hypervisor. These packages install the hypervisor, or a set of modules that provide virtualization features, on top of the operating system.\n\nIn summary, virtualization software creates a virtual environment that runs on top of the host operating system. The hypervisor manages the resources of the VMs and hosts, while the operating system and applications run on top of it. The virtualization software is implemented using the hypervisor modules, which are installed on top of the operating system."}

Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds.", "answer": "Here is a quick summary of each parameter and its corresponding value or range of values:\n\n1. R*: The average rate of star formation in the galaxy, usually measured in stars per year. This is one of the most uncertain parameters in the Drake Equation, and is usually estimated using a combination of observations and theoretical calculations. Values range from roughly 0.01 to 100 stars per year.\n\n2. fp: The fraction of stars that form planets. This parameter is also highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the vast majority of stars do indeed have planets. Values range from roughly 0.01 to 1.\n\n3. ne: The number of habitable planets in the galaxy. This parameter is also highly uncertain, but studies suggest that there could be tens of billions of potentially habitable planets in the galaxy. Values range from roughly 1 to 100 billion.\n\n4. fl: The fraction of habitable planets that develop life. Again, this parameter is highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the vast majority of habitable planets do develop life. Values range from roughly 0.01 to 1.\n\n5. fli: The fraction of planets with life that develop intelligence. This parameter is again highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the vast majority of planets with life do develop intelligence. Values range from roughly 0.01 to 1.\n\n6. fc: The fraction of intelligent species that achieve communications technology. This parameter is again highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the vast majority of intelligent species do develop communications technology. Values range from roughly 0.01 to 1.\n\n7. L: The average lifetime of a communicating species in years. This parameter is highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the average lifetime is on the order of tens of thousands of years. Values range from roughly 10,000 to 10 million years.\n\n8. fL: The fraction of communicating species that develop technology that permits interstellar travel. This parameter is again highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the vast majority of communicating species do develop such technology. Values range from roughly 0.01 to 1.\n\n9. F: The average number of civilisations in our galaxy that develop interstellar travel. This parameter is highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that there could be thousands of communicating civilisations in the galaxy. Values range from roughly 1 to 10,000.\n\n10. λ: The average number of civilisations that develop advanced technologies that make contact with neighbouring civilisations per year. This parameter is again highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that there could be tens of contact events per year. Values range from roughly 0.01 to 10.\n\n11. ρ: The average distance in light years between two neighbouring civilisations in our galaxy that make contact. This parameter is highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the average distance is on the order of 10 light years. Values range from roughly 1 to 100 light years.\n\n12. R: The average number of civilisations in our galaxy that are discovered per year. This parameter is again highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that there could be tens of discoveries per year. Values range from roughly 0.01 to 10.\n\n13. 1/fb: The average length of time that a civilisation stays detectable before becoming undetectable. This parameter is highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the average length of time is on the order of tens of thousands of years. Values range from roughly 10,000 to 1 million years.\n\n14. fd: The fraction of detected civilisations that are actually communicating at the time they are detected. This parameter is again highly uncertain, but recent studies suggest that the vast majority of detected civilisations are communicating at the time they are detected. Values range from roughly 0.01 to 1.\n\nUsing these values, the Drake Equation can be expressed as follows:\n\n\\(N = R \\times \\frac{1}{f_{d}} \\times \\frac{1}{F} \\times \\frac{1}{L} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{L}} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{c}} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{i}} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{f}} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{li}} \\times \\frac{1}{f_{n"}

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

All you need, then, as a billing system, is to be able to deliver value in a commercially intelligent way.\n\n2.When you focus on the things that, as a natural consequence, produce what it is you're looking for, you're eight times more likely to engage in honest, open, and constructive behavior.\n\n3.The pursuit of success is also the pursuit of failure.

{"id": "koala_148", "prompt": "#2. To increase the energy efficiency of windows, additional glass pane is added. In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "1. Yes, a double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window. This is because the more layers of glass, the more air pockets there are between the glass panes, which provides better insulation. However, a single pane window is not more efficient than a double pane window, because a single pane window would have no insulating value.\n\n2. A double pane window can be more efficient than a single pane window, if the air space between the panes is well-insulated, using materials such as krypton or argon gas. This helps to reduce the heat transfer between the inside and outside of the house, making the window more energy-efficient.\n\n3. The overall energy efficiency of a window depends on a variety of factors, such as the amount of visible light transmitted, the thermal conductivity of the glass and the U-value of the window. The U-value of a window is a measure of how well it resists heat flow, and is calculated by dividing the rate of heat flow through the window by the difference in temperature across the window. For example, a window with a U-value of 1.0 W/m2K means that the window transmits one watt of heat for every square meter of area, for every degree Celsius difference in temperature across the window.\n\nThe energy efficiency of a window can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nEnergy Efficiency (kWh/m2yr) = (U-value) x (Area of the window) x (Solar Insolation) x (Energy Efficiency Factor)\n\nwhere the Solar Insolation refers to the amount of solar radiation that hits the window, and the Energy Efficiency Factor is a factor that takes into account the type of glass used, the type of frame, and the installation of the window.\n\nThe U-value of a window can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nU-value = ((Solar Heat Gain Coefficient) x (Air Permeability)) / (Thermal Conductivity of Glass)\n\nwhere the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient is a measure of the amount of heat that is transmitted through the window, and the Air Permeability is a measure of how well the window blocks airflow. The Thermal Conductivity of Glass is a constant, which is approximately 1.1 W/mK for regular glass.\n\nThe energy efficiency of the window can then be calculated using the above equation.\n\nIn summary, a double pane window can be more energy-efficient than a single pane window, if the air space between the panes is well-insulated, using materials such as krypton or argon gas. This helps to reduce the heat transfer between the inside and outside of the house, making the window more energy-efficient.\n\nIn general, the energy efficiency of a window depends on a variety of factors, such as the amount of visible light transmitted, the thermal conductivity of the glass, the type of frame, and the installation of the window.\n\nTo calculate the energy efficiency of a window, you can use the following formula:\n\nEnergy Efficiency (kWh/m2yr) = (U-value) x (Area of the window) x (Solar Insolation) x (Energy Efficiency Factor)\n\nwhere the Solar Insolation refers to the amount of solar radiation that hits the window, and the Energy Efficiency Factor is a factor that takes into account the type of glass used, the type of frame, and the installation of the window.\n\nThe U-value of a window can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nU-value = ((Solar Heat Gain Coefficient) x (Air Permeability)) / (Thermal Conductivity of Glass)\n\nwhere the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient is a measure of the amount of heat that is transmitted through the window, and the Air Permeability is a measure of how well the window blocks airflow.

{"id": "koala_149", "prompt": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment?", "answer": "Etienne Balibar identifies three approaches to violence in politics: violence of the State, violence of the people, and violence of the individual. In his view, violence can be justified as a means of counter-violence, repression, or liberation, depending on the context and the intentions of the actor.\n\nIn his book Violence and the Word, Frantz Fanon discusses the colonial violence inflicted on the native population by the European colonizers. He argues that the natives are forced to respond in kind, using violence to fight their oppressors. He writes: \"If violence is to be used, it can only be used in the service of the oppressed.\"\n\nIn his book The Politics of Hope, Slavoj Žižek, echoing Fanon, argues that violence is often necessary for the liberation of the oppressed. He writes: \"In order to defend themselves against the oppressor's violence, the oppressed are obliged to use violence, and this violence will then be treated as evil by the oppressor.\"\n\nArthur Kahane, in his book The American Jewish Establishment: Its Economic Power, Its Ideological Submission, argues that the American Jewish establishment has been complicit in the oppression of Palestinians, and that violence is necessary to counter this oppression. He writes: \"The only way for the Jewish people to protect itself is to use violence against those who are using violence against it.\"\n\nIn summary, Kahane's ethics of violence echoes Fanon and Žižek when it comes to the use of violence for the liberation of the oppressed. However, there are key differences. Fanon and Žižek argue that violence can be ethically justified, while Kahane's argument is that violence is necessary and unavoidable."}

TypeScript is often used in combination with the Angular JavaScript framework, which uses TypeScript as its primary language.\n\nIn TypeScript, variables and functions are declared with their type, which tells the compiler what kind of data or behavior the variable or function will have. This helps the compiler to enforce data type checks and prevent common errors such as undefined variables, null types, and mismatched types.\n\nDuck Typing is a type system that loosely enforces data types, where variables and functions can be declared with any type, as long as it satisfies the expected behavior of its usage. This allows for flexible variable and function declarations, where the type is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. This style of programming is useful for dynamically typed languages, where it can help to reduce the amount of type checking and code verification that needs to be done at runtime.\n\nIn summary, TypeScript is a type-checking language that enforces data type checks at compile time, while Duck Typing is a loosely-typed system that allows for flexible variable and function declarations, where the type is determined at runtime.\n\nHope this helps!"}

{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "1. Insufficient funding for agricultural research and extension: Investment in research, technology and extension is critical for developing agriculture in Africa, but only 4% of the continent’s agricultural budget is spent on research and development. This is significantly lower than the global average of 12%.\n2. Poor infrastructure: Africa has the lowest agricultural productivity in the world, in large part due to inadequate infrastructure such as roads, irrigation systems, storage facilities and markets.\n3. Lack of mechanization: Smallholder farmers in Africa often work with little or no mechanization, which limits their ability to increase productivity.\n4. Unpredictable weather: Climate change is affecting the agricultural sector in Africa, with more frequent droughts and floods.\n5. Low agricultural output: The continent produces less than 10% of the world’s agricultural output, despite having one-third of the world’s arable land.\n6. High food prices: Food prices in Africa are high, which makes it difficult for smallholder farmers to produce and sell their crops.\n7. Lack of markets: Most African countries lack adequate agricultural markets, which makes it difficult for farmers to access high-quality inputs and sell their produce at a fair price.\n8. Lack of skilled labour: There is a shortage of skilled labour in the agricultural sector, particularly in rural areas.\n9. Lack of access to credit: Farmers often lack access to credit, making it difficult for them to invest in agricultural inputs or expand their operations.\n10. Lack of land ownership: Many farmers in Africa do not own the land they work, limiting their ability to invest or improve their yields.\n11. Lack of political will: Due to the low priority given to agriculture, there is a lack of political will to address the challenges facing the sector."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. It refers to the long-term warming of the Earth's average temperature due to the increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. This warming is projected to cause drastic environmental changes, including rising sea levels, severe weather events, and the extinction of many species.\n\nClimate change poses a significant threat to our planet and its inhabitants. It has already had a devastating impact on many communities around the world, and its effects will only become more severe in the coming years if action is not taken to curb its emissions.\n\nIn order to effectively combat climate change, we must reduce our carbon footprint by transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and reducing our consumption of meat and other products from deforested land. We must also work together to raise awareness about the dangers of climate change and promote sustainable practices. Taking these steps will help reduce emissions and slow down the rate of global warming, paving the way for a more sustainable future for all."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "It may feel like less effort, but it's actually a lot more work, particularly if the TV episodes are long. The brain is a complex organ, and it requires a lot of energy to stay focused on one activity for such a long time. It's more likely that you become tired, and less likely that you'll be able to stay engaged with the content.\n\nWatching a film, on the other hand, requires a lot less mental energy, and is more likely to hold your attention. It's also more likely to feel like less effort, because you're not actively trying to remain focused on the content, it's just happening in the background.\n\nOverall, it's much better for your brain to take a break and watch a film, rather than spending hours in front of the TV."}

{"id": "koala_169", "prompt": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence?", "answer": "It is rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence if there is subjective evidence to support the belief. For example, in the absence of objective evidence, a person may have a subjective experience of the presence of \"God\" or a \"Higher Power.\" While there is no objective evidence to support the existence of \"God\" or a \"Higher Power,\" the subjective experience of having such a belief may be rational.\n\nIn addition, a person's beliefs can be rational if they are based on logical reasoning. For example, if a person believes that the world is round because they have seen pictures or video footage that show its curvature, then their belief would be rational, as it is based on logical reasoning and evidence.\n\nHowever, if a person's belief is not based on subjective evidence or logical reasoning, then it would not be rational to believe it, no matter how strongly they feel about it.

I am fighting Yugoloths in Gehenna. I roll to attack them with my +1 Rapier. Does a 24 hit?", "answer": "No, because the attack has a +2 enhancement bonus from the rapier. It becomes a +24 attack, but due to the enhancement bonus, it only counts as a +22 attack. So, it would count as a 22 hit.\n\nHere's another example:\n\nMy rogue has an unarmed strike with a +5 enhancement bonus. If I attack a 10 HD creature, my unarmed strike would count as a 45 hit, not a 50 hit.\n\nHowever, here's another example where the enhancement bonus would cause the attack to count as a 50 hit:\n\nMy rogue has a +1 rapier with a +5 enhancement bonus. If I attack a 10 HD creature, my rapier strike would count as a +25 attack, which would be a 50 hit.\n\nIf you need to know whether or not an attack would count as a critical hit, you can use the following formula:\n\nCritical hit chance = (attack bonus + enhancement bonus) / 2\n\nFor example, if my rogue's unarmed strike had a +10 attack bonus and a +5 enhancement bonus, it would have a critical hit chance of (10 + 5) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3."}

We can use the rule of 72 to calculate how many months it will take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants.\n\nUsing the rule of 72, we know that the number of years it takes to double the money at a fixed interest rate is `72 / (interest rate)` years.\n\nTherefore, it will take the man `72 / (0.39 + 0.25) = 72 / 0.64` years to double his money.\n\nThis means that it will take the man `72 / 0.64 * 12` months, or `48` months, to save up enough money to buy the car he wants.\n\nIn addition, since he also has to pay for the purchase of the secondhand car, we can calculate the amount of money he will have left over.\n\nUsing the rule of 72 again, we can say that it will take `72 / (0.39 + 0.25) = 72 / 0.64` years for the price of the secondhand car to double.\n\nTherefore, it will take the man `72 / 0.64 * 12` months, or `48` months, to have enough money to buy the secondhand car plus the money he will have left over.\n\nIn summary, it will take the man `48` months to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, and he will have `48` months + `48` months, or `96` months, to have enough money to buy the secondhand car plus the money he will have left over.\n\nIn total, it will take the man `96` months, or `8` years, to have enough money to buy the car he wants and the secondhand car he wants."}

Include claims on detailed processes involved, system architecture and algorithms", "answer": "Here is a detailed description of an innovative and novel way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates, using verifiable credentials, digital wallet on a blockchain as a payment provision, and machine learning.\n\n1. Identify the problem:\n\nOne of the major challenges faced by our local bodies is the inefficiency of the process of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances. The traditional process involves submitting a physical application form and relevant documents, along with paying the required fees, to the local body for verification, before issuing the certificate. This process is time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to delays in issuing the certificate, and in some cases, the certificate being rejected.\n\n2. Identify the solution:\n\nAn innovative and novel way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates, using verifiable credentials, a digital wallet on a blockchain as a payment provision, and machine learning, has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the process.\n\n3. System Architecture:\n\nThe system architecture of the proposed solution is depicted below:\n\nFigure 1: System Architecture of the proposed solution \n\n4. Verification of application and documents:\n\nThe application form and documents submitted by the applicant will be digitally verified to ensure that they are original and meet the requirements. This can be done by using a digital signature or blockchain-based verification methods.\n\n5. Authentication:\n\nThe applicant will be authenticated using verifiable credentials such as Aadhaar or biometric authentication, to ensure that they are the rightful applicant.\n\n6. Payment:\n\nThe required fees for issuing the certificate will be collected using a digital wallet on a blockchain, where the funds can be transferred securely between the applicant and the local body. This will eliminate the need to handle cash or cheques, and reduce the risk of fraud or misappropriation of funds.\n\n7. Data collection:\n\nThe local body will collect and store the relevant data of the applicant in their database, such as name, address, contact details, etc.\n\n8. Issuance of certificate:\n\nThe local body will issue the certificate to the applicant, either through digital means (such as sending a digital copy via email) or through a physical medium (such as a printed copy).\n\n9. Validation of certificate:\n\nThe local body can check the validity of the certificate using the unique ID generated by the system, to ensure that it has not been tampered or duplicated. This can be done using blockchain-based methods.\n\n10. Storage and archiving:\n\nThe local body will store the certificate and relevant data in their database, for future reference.\n\n11. Maintenance and upgrades:\n\nThe system can be maintained and upgraded by the local body, as and when necessary.\n\n12. Data privacy and security:\n\nThe system will ensure the privacy and security of the data of the applicant, by using encryption and other security measures.\n\nThe proposed solution has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the process of issuing community tax certificates, and other relevant permits and clearances, while reducing the risk of fraud and misappropriation of funds. It can also be scaled up to other local bodies, or even extended to other processes in the government, such as issuing driving licenses, passports, etc."}
{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " of of (of of [of ((w of (of ([: (((stry ( [ – and, ( ( - ( ((n of ( - of and ( – of [ - of of ( of ( of (k of of of of [of of of of of of [of of of of of of of of of of and of of the of ((c of [do of – or and, and [st [and – and or of the of, of [[h of our of, that of our of (per – and -t –g -th ((and – or and of (c of (be of ( ( (ne of, and (?
