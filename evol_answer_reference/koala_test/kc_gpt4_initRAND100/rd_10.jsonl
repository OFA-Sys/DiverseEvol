{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banks use a variety of tools and instruments to manage their risks, one of which is the requirement to maintain a certain level of capital to cushion against potential losses.  Cash, as a liability on the balance sheet, is not an acceptable form of capital for banks because it is a liquid asset that can be easily converted into cash, and thus, it does not provide an adequate buffer against potential losses.  Banks need to maintain a certain level of capital as a cushion against potential losses to protect depositors' funds, maintain the stability of the financial system, and comply with regulatory requirements. Cash is highly liquid and can be easily converted into cash, and thus, it does not provide the same level of protection as capital that is invested in illiquid assets. Additionally, cash is a liability on the balance sheet, and the value of the cash may fluctuate depending on market conditions, which may impact a bank's capital requirements. In summary, while cash can be used as a source of funding for banks, it cannot be used as capital as a buffer against potential losses."}

To convert from one time zone to another, you can use the time zone converters. For example, to convert from Pacific Standard Time to Asia/Taipei Time, you can use the following formula:\n\nPacific Standard Time to Asia/Taipei Time = (Pacific Standard Time - 08:00) / 15\n\nSo, 1:00 PM - 08:00 (hours) = 0 hours\n1:00 PM - 08:00 (hours) / 15 (minutes in an hour) = 0 hours / 15 minutes\n0 hours / 15 minutes = 0 minutes\n\nTherefore, December 21, 2020 from 1:00 PM – 1:50 PM (Pacific Standard Time) is equal to December 21, 2020 from 12:00 PM – 12:50 PM (Asia/Taipei Time)."}

Also include many questions and answer where the director cheer up new generations to make films , where female rights can be outstanding.", "answer": "Interview with Female Film Director\n\nJournalist: Hello Madame Director, thank you for this interview. Could you please introduce yourself to our viewers and tell us about your background in filmmaking?\n\nDirector: Certainly. My name is Jane Doe and I am a Female Film Director from the United States. I graduated from the Film School at New York University with a degree in Directing. My first short film won several awards at film festivals and inspired me to pursue a career in directing feature films.\n\nJ: That’s very impressive! Could you tell us about your latest project and how you became involved in it?\n\nD: Sure! My latest project is a historical drama called “Lady Liberty”. It’s set in 1888 and tells the story of a young woman who travels from Russia to the United States to escape her abusive husband. She finds work as a seamstress in a garment factory on the Lower East Side and eventually meets Emily Wilding Davison, a suffragette who teaches her about female rights. The film explores the struggle of women to gain the right to vote and features an all-female cast and crew, including myself as the director.\n\nJ: That sounds like an incredibly powerful film. How did you come up with the idea for it?\n\nD: The idea for “Lady Liberty” came from a book I read about the life of Emily Wilding Davison, who is best known for her death while trying to attach a suffragette flag to the car of King George V during the 1913 Epsom Derby. I was deeply moved by her story and wanted to tell it in a film that would inspire women to stand up for their rights, just as she did.\n\nJ: That’s very inspiring. As a female filmmaker, what do you think is the biggest challenge that women face in the film industry?\n\nD: One of the biggest challenges that women face in the film industry is the lack of opportunities to direct feature films. Women make up only about 7% of all directors in Hollywood, and that number has remained stagnant for decades. This lack of representation not only affects women, but also has a negative impact on the films themselves, as studies have shown that films with female directors are more likely to have female protagonists, and they earn more at the box office.\n\nJ: That’s extremely disappointing. Do you have any advice for young women who aspire to direct films?\n\nD: Yes, I do. I would say to them not to be discouraged by the statistics, but to use them as motivation to create their own opportunities. There are many ways for women to direct films, from independent and web-based projects to writing and directing their own screenplays. The key is to not give up and to keep creating the content that they want to see.\n\nJ: That’s very encouraging. Thank you so much for your time, Madame Director. We’re sure that your film will inspire many women to stand up for their rights.\n\nD: Thank you for having me. It’s been a pleasure."}

This value is measured in kilocalories (kCal) and it is determined by the chemical composition of the food. Protein, carbohydrates, and fats all contain calories, but the amount of calories varies depending on the specific type of nutrient and its chemical structure. For example, not all proteins and fats contain the same amount of calories, and the same is true for carbohydrates.\n\nFood is also composed of other nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and other electrolytes. These nutrients do not have caloric value, meaning that their presence in food does not affect the food's caloric value.

However, since the question asks about the difference in their budgets, let's say that Navina's weekly budget is $150 while her sister's is $120. This means that Navina has an additional $30 per week that she can spend.\n\nSo, if Navina wants to get an online credit card, she could spend up to $30 of her additional budget on the card's annual fee, if any. If there is no annual fee, she could spend the entire $30 or even more, depending on her spending habits and the credit limit of the card.\n\nOn the other hand, if her sister wants to get an online credit card, she would have to reduce her weekly budget by $30 to account for the cost of the card. So, if her weekly budget was $120, she would have to bring it down to $90, which means that she would have to spend less or cut back on something in her budget."}

Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data.

{"id": "koala_25", "prompt": "Write me a 2000 word essay on a water safety engineering project.", "answer": "Water safety engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of water-related structures, such as dams, levees, and water conveyance systems, with the aim of ensuring their safety and reliability. This project aims to design an innovative flood control system for a city that is prone to flooding.\n\nThe city of XYZ is located in a river basin that is frequently affected by flooding. Several flood control measures have been implemented in the past, but they have not been able to address the problem adequately. The current proposal aims to develop a new system that can effectively reduce the risk of flooding for the residents of XYZ.\n\nThe flood control system will consist of a network of underground stormwater storage tanks, an advanced flood forecasting system, and a pumping station. The stormwater storage tanks will be located in strategic locations throughout the city and will be used to hold back excess water during periods of heavy rainfall. The advanced flood forecasting system will use cutting-edge technologies, such as satellite imaging and big data analytics, to predict the likely extent and timing of flooding. When the flood warning is issued, the pumping station will activate, pumping water from the storage tanks to a lower elevation, thus reducing the pressure on the dams and levees.\n\nThe design of the stormwater storage tanks and the pumping station will be optimized to ensure that the system can cope with the worst-case flooding scenario. The location of the tanks will be carefully chosen to minimize the impact on existing buildings and infrastructure. The pumping station will be designed to handle the discharge of large volumes of water efficiently and quickly.\n\nThe implementation of this flood control system will significantly reduce the risk of flooding for the people of XYZ. The advanced forecasting system will provide early warning of any impending floods, giving residents and emergency services time to take appropriate action. The underground storage tanks will prevent the water from reaching dangerous levels by storing excess water, thereby reducing the pressure on the dams and levees. Finally, the pumping station will ensure that the water is drained away safely, preventing flooding in low-lying areas.\n\nIn summary, this water safety engineering project aims to design an innovative flood control system for the city of XYZ that will reduce the risk of flooding and improve the safety and resilience of the community."}

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "Instance segmentation is a widely-used task in computer vision, with applications in medical imaging, autonomous driving, and many other fields. In this task, the goal is to predict the instance-level labels of objects in an image. One way to evaluate the performance of an instance segmentation model is by measuring its average precision (AP), which is the mean of the AP scores of all instances in the image. However, AP alone does not take into account the location of the predicted instance bounding boxes, and may therefore fail to accurately reflect the model's performance.\n\nOne way to improve the AP metrics of an instance segmentation model is by incorporating human expert knowledge. This can be done by providing the model with label maps, which are binary masks generated by experts that indicate the presence or absence of each instance in the image. By comparing the model's predictions with the label maps, we can obtain a more accurate measure of the model's performance.\n\nSpecifically, one approach is to use the intersection-over-union (IoU) measure between the model's predictions and the label maps. This metric computes the intersection of the predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes, and then divides it by the union of the two sets. By incorporating human label maps into the evaluation process, the AP metrics of the instance segmentation model can be improved, producing more accurate and informative results."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " [co �.. �@.

People who hold ideological beliefs tend to be dogmatic in their thinking, and are unwavering in their adherence to those beliefs, even in the face of contradictory evidence.\n\nInconsistency, on the other hand, refers to the quality of being inconsistent or inconsistent in one's actions, decisions or beliefs. Inconsistency often arises from a lack of coherent thinking or reasoning, and can be characterized by a failure to follow logical or rational principles.\n\nIn essence, inconsistency is the result of poor thinking or reasoning, while ideological thinking is the result of holding strong, unwavering beliefs, regardless of the evidence. Inconsistency can arise from ideological thinking, as a result of the inability to reconcile conflicting beliefs, but inconsistency itself is not an ideological phenomenon."}

According to Taleb, the idea of market efficiency is based on the assumption that all relevant information is already reflected in the current price of a security. However, he argues that there is always a chance that new information can arise that was not previously taken into account, causing the price of a security to change.

MFCC stands for Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, which are features used in speech processing and recognition. They are calculated from a Mel-spectogram, which is a smoothed and logarithmic representation of the mel-frequency spectrum of a voice signal. The difference between MFCC and MEL-spectogram is that MFCC is an algorithm that produces a set of features, whereas a MEL-spectogram is a representation of the features."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "  theme  the topic  topic  topic ificistificist sentence 1 topic code phrients (specificist, ightistificistificificary topic framework ificify your [  \"Your language  the 2  the ound ounical topic \n \n ullical "}
{"id": "koala_50", "prompt": "Mill vs Gartner\nThis case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"? Include a summary for each.", "answer": "The first case, \"Mill vs Gartner,\" is not a good fit for the given query as it does not involve a mine lease dispute.

His father was a great warrior and a member of the tribe's ruling council, while his mother was a powerful shaman who could cast spells and commune with the spirits of the forest.\n\nAs a child, Raven was a curious and adventurous boy who spent most of his time exploring the forest and learning about the creatures that lived there. He quickly became friends with a group of young orphaned animals that had been abandoned by their parents - a pack of wolf cubs, a band of baby raccoons, and a litter of young foxes. Together, the band of friends would play in the forest and hunt for food.\n\nHowever, all this changed one day when a group of human raiders attacked the elven village. In the chaos that followed, Raven's parents were killed and the whole tribe was forced to flee. The raiders burned the elven settlement to the ground, and Raven and his friends were separated from each other.\n\nDevastated by the loss of his family and friends, Raven set off into the forest alone, determined to find his friends and avenge the death of his parents. For weeks he searched, but he could not find any trace of his friends or the raiders. Eventually, he was forced to return to the elven settlement, now in ruins, and live with other displaced half-elves.\n\nYears passed and Raven became a skilled warrior, learning the ways of the elven sword from his father's friends. He also learned to track and hunt, skills that would help him survive in the forest.\n\nOne day, while out on a hunting trip, Raven came across a group of humans who were slaughtering wild animals for their meat. Enraged by their cruelty, Raven attacked the humans and killed them all. When he returned to the elven settlement, the elders were outraged by his actions and banished him from the tribe.\n\nDespite the elders' warnings, Raven could not forget the cruelty he had seen and he continued to roam the forest, determined to protect the creatures that could not defend themselves. Eventually, he discovered a group of orphaned animals and helped them establish a new home in a secret cave. He became their guardian, teaching them to hunt and protect themselves. For the first time in years, Raven felt hopeful again.\n\nOne day, while hunting in the forest, Raven came across a group of half-elves who were being captured by goblins. Without thinking, he attacked the goblins and rescued the half-elves. When he returned to the secret cave, the animals were waiting for him, and together they planned their revenge.\n\nUsing his elven sword and the help of his animal friends, Raven tracked down the goblin tribe and destroyed it, avenging the death of his parents and rescuing the half-elves. From that day on, Raven became known as the Half-Elf Ranger, a legendary hero who would never abandon those in need."}

This is why it's crucial to closely monitor people who take anti-depressants for any changes in mood, behavior, or thoughts.\n\nIt's important to note that these side effects are not specific to anti-depressants and may occur with any type of medication that treats depression or mood disorders. This means that if someone is experiencing suicidal thoughts or behaviors while taking an anti-depressant, they should let their doctor know right away so that the dosage can be adjusted or another treatment can be tried.\n\nOverall, the benefits of anti-depressants usually outweigh the risks, but it's important for people to be aware of the potential side effects and to speak to their doctor if they experience any changes in their mood, behavior or thoughts while taking these medications."}

{"id": "koala_66", "prompt": "explain the basics of area and perimeter", "answer": "Area is a measure of the size or extent of a two-dimensional surface. It is commonly measured in square meters (m²) or square feet (ft²). The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is as follows: Area = length × width. In other words, the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width.\n\nPerimeter is a measure of the distance around the outer edge of a two-dimensional shape, such as a square or circle. It is calculated by adding the lengths of all the sides of the shape. The formula for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2*(length) + 2*(width) . In other words, the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the diagonal lengths plus the lengths of the four sides.\n\nArea and perimeter are two important concepts in geometry and are often used to describe the size and shape of two-dimensional figures. Understanding the basics of area and perimeter is essential for anyone working with two-dimensional shapes and figures."}

Anakin was on his way to the local market when he stumbled upon a Jedi who spoke and acted as if he was a 1920s British aristocrat.\n\nThe Jedi greeted Anakin with a bow and a charming smile. \"Good day to you, my boy,\" he said. \"Have you come to the market to purchase some fresh produce?\"\n\nAnakin nodded. \"Yes, I need to buy some food for my mother.\"\n\n\"Oh, how kind of you to think of your poor mother.

If the car has a fuel tank capacity of 13 gallons (50 liters), the cost of fuel for a 14-mile journey would be approximately 625 pence (GBP) or $0.82 (USD).\n\nHowever, there are several factors that can affect the actual cost of fuel. These include the price of oil, the type of car, traffic conditions, and the driving style of the driver. If the price of oil is high, the cost of fuel will also be higher. If the car has poor fuel economy or is not well maintained, the actual fuel consumption will be higher, which will affect the cost of fuel.\n\nHeavy traffic can also increase the cost of fuel as the car will be idling in traffic instead of moving, wasting fuel. Likewise, if the driver accelerates quickly or brakes frequently, the engine will have to work harder, using more fuel.\n\nIn summary, the cost of fuel for a 14-mile journey in a car with 48mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon and there is heavy traffic for half the journey will vary depending on several factors and is difficult to accurately predict."}

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a computational technique used to solve engineering problems involving heat, stress, and electric fields. It is a powerful tool used by engineers to analyze the behavior of complex structures and systems.\n\nAt its most basic level, the FEM involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller parts called elements. These elements can be cubes, rectangles, or other shapes, and they represent the building blocks of the structure. For example, if you are analyzing the behavior of a beam, you might divide the beam into a large number of smaller elements.\n\nOnce the elements have been defined, a finite element is created for each element. These elements can have different shapes and sizes, and they can be arranged in a variety of different patterns. The finite element is a mathematical representation of the element, and it contains information about its geometry and properties.\n\nThe FEM then involves solving a set of equations to determine the stress, displacement, or other variables within the elements. These equations are derived from applying laws of physics, such as the principle of conservation of momentum or Newton's laws of motion, to the problem at hand.\n\nTo solve the equations, an iterative technique called the load-deployment method is commonly used. In this method, the loads on the structure (such as the weight of an object or the force of wind) are applied to the elements, and the behavior of the structure is observed. Based on these observations, the loads are then adjusted to achieve a desired response. This process is repeated until the desired solution is obtained.\n\nOverall, the FEM is an extremely powerful tool that enables engineers to analyze and understand the behavior of complex structures and systems. It provides a quantitative method for predicting the performance of a design, which is invaluable in the engineering field."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " ([(p,  [(idea, (inf, [(h (h, [d (c (vis [h (c (([ ( ( ( ( (p ( of [of ( of ( of the of of of  (–(inf of (( ([ of ( (® (-t (® [c [ve (mark [(inf [([link (p [(p (main (f [p ([inter [[[((((ve ([ais ([(dis [[specific [-reg, (scri ([[d ((d [br (gener  ((d ((ink (((per, (in, ((inf ((in, (of of ((d of of, of (of (f, (of (of of of, of ((inf, [(inf, (c, (inf, ((per (d (com (d [(h ((( - (  ( of ( of ( of ( of ( of ( of (of of ( of (of ( of ( of ([of of [(inf of ((dis ([f [([j of [center ([(cer [( [-inf ((( (((in ([((in (h (of (: [se ((inf (((( ((((h ((l, (h (( (per ( ( ([((f of (( (( (((sen (p ((d ((((((c (((ve (((([[[-d (d (sur ((((b (( ( ((m (((((f (((h ((sp (sur ((( ( (c ( ( (f ( ((  ( (subject  (-in ((d [vers ((f ((dis ([(sa ((f (per (d [([of ((( (( ((((((( ((((--h ([( (sp [-m (( (-d (-l (---( ((-c (c ((-subject (((((([(inf (( (((ve (((d ((( (( ( ( of ( of ( of ( of of (of of, (of of (* of (( ( ( (, (–(b (d, ( (, (( ((( ((, (of of [, (( (( ( (-of of (– of, of, [-in of ( (–([( ([ink ((-cont, ((?

Both cities offer stunning natural beauty, a warm and welcoming community, and a rich cultural heritage. Here are my observations and experiences of living in these two diverse locations.\n\n#### Flagstaff, Arizona\n\nFlagstaff, located in the high desert of northern Arizona, is a thriving college town known for its breathtaking scenery, vibrant art scene, and outdoor adventure opportunities. Growing up in the bustling city of Honolulu, Hawaii, I was captivated by the stunning views of the San Francisco Peaks, the highest mountain range in Arizona, as well as the vast pine forests that blanket the city. The town’s vibrant and diverse cultural scene is also a major draw, with a thriving Latinx community, a large Native American population, and a burgeoning LGBTQ+ scene. The town’s rich history and strong sense of community make it a truly unique place to live.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Flagstaff is the abundance of outdoor activities available year-round. From hiking and camping in the surrounding wilderness to skiing and snowboarding at the nearby ski resorts, there is an activity for everyone. The city also boasts a vibrant music and arts scene, with numerous live music venues, art galleries and museums.\n\nFlagstaff is a welcoming and inclusive community, and I have felt very at home there. It is a great place to explore, and I have learned a lot about the history and culture of the region by interacting with the friendly and knowledgeable people who live there.\n\nIn summary, living in Flagstaff has been a truly enriching experience, offering stunning natural beauty, a vibrant cultural scene, and a warm and welcoming community.\n\n\n#### Kaneohe, Hawaii\n\nKaneohe is a small town on the island of Oahu, known for its stunning tropical landscape, breathtaking views of the mountains and ocean, and a rich history dating back to ancient Polynesian settlement. Growing up in Honolulu, I was used to the hustle and bustle of a major metropolitan area, but Kaneohe offered a much more tranquil lifestyle. The town is located on the eastern side of the island, away from the busy tourist areas, making it a great place to escape the city and enjoy the peace and quiet of the natural surroundings.\n\nKaneohe’s close proximity to the ocean means that the town is home to numerous water sports and activities, including surfing, snorkeling, and diving. The town’s lush tropical vegetation and stunning mountain backdrop create a picturesque setting for outdoor adventures.\n\nThe community of Kaneohe is also very tight-knit and welcoming, with a strong sense of pride and aloha (love) for their town. The town’s history, as a hub for the local fishing industry, is still evident in the form of quaint seafood shops and the weekly farmers market.\n\nIn summary, living in Kaneohe has been a truly enriching experience, offering stunning natural beauty, a vibrant cultural scene, and a warm and welcoming community."}

{"id": "koala_96", "prompt": "assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual", "answer": "Welcome to my office! As a therapist, my first priority is to ensure that you feel comfortable and safe sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. To start, let’s go over a technique called a pause ritual that can help you become less reactive in challenging situations.\n\nThe pause ritual involves taking a moment to breathe deeply and calmly before responding to a stressful situation. This can help you to think more clearly and respond more effectively. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. Identify the trigger: When you feel your emotions starting to rise, take a moment to pause and ask yourself what is triggering your reaction. Is someone saying something that is upsetting you? Are you feeling judged or criticized?\n\n2. Take a deep breath: Inhale through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth, counting to 4 as you do. This will help you to calm down and steady your breathing.\n\n3. Reflect on your reaction: Now that you have taken a moment to pause and breathe, take some time to reflect on your reaction. Is your response appropriate for the situation? Have you said anything you regret?\n\n4. Respond calmly and rationally: Once you have taken a moment to pause, breathe, and reflect on your reaction, you are in a better position to respond calmly and rationally. You may choose to respond by saying something like, “I appreciate your feedback, but I’m not sure I agree. Can we talk about it further so that we can come to a mutually satisfactory solution?”\n\nThe pause ritual is a simple yet effective tool for becoming less reactive in stressful situations. Practicing it regularly can help you to take control of your emotions, think more clearly, and respond calmly and effectively to challenging situations."}

Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

Predictive customer engagement: Churned's AI-based churn prediction models could be combined with Accurat.ai's real-time location intelligence to provide our customers with a more accurate and detailed view of their customers' behavior both online and offline. This could help our customers to identify opportunities for customer engagement in real-time, and to take immediate action to prevent churn.\n\n3. Cross-channel predictions: Churned's AI-based customer churn prediction models could be integrated with Accurat.ai's real-time location intelligence to provide our customers with a more accurate and detailed view of their customers' behavior across multiple channels. This could help our customers to identify cross-channel customer behavior patterns, and to develop more effective and holistic strategies to reduce churn.\n\n4.

I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "Krishnamurti's educational philosophy is based on the idea that true learning can only occur when one is able to observe the functioning of their own thoughts and emotions without judgement or attachment. In aikido, this would mean that the instructor would facilitate a space for students to practice without any expectations or goals, allowing them to simply observe their own reactions and responses to the techniques. As aikido is a martial art that requires physical and mental discipline, this approach would also encourage students to develop a deep awareness of their bodies and the present moment, and to develop a non-judgemental attitude towards themselves and others.\n\nIn the dojo, this could be achieved through practices such as meditation, mindfulness, and non-violent communication, which would help students to develop a greater sense of self-awareness and compassion. The aim of the practice would not be to achieve a certain level or rank, but rather to foster a sense of connection, community, and respect for oneself and others.\n\nOverall, I believe that the teaching of aikido based on the educational ideas of Krishnamurti could be a deeply transformative experience for students, as it would encourage them to develop a greater understanding of themselves and the world around them through direct experience."}

{"id": "koala_133", "prompt": "Why did the building of a pipeline have to be voted on by the government(USA)? Doesn't this infringe on government interfering with private corporations?<br>", "answer": "The building of a pipeline is a complex and expensive project that requires the coordination of multiple parties including government regulators, private companies, and landowners. For this reason, it is usually subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation, and the approval of a pipeline project by the government is not considered to be an infringement on private corporations.\n\nIn the United States, pipeline projects are typically reviewed and approved by several government agencies including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state regulatory bodies. These agencies assess the safety and environmental impacts of a proposed pipeline and ensure that it is built according to strict safety and construction standards.\n\nIn summary, the building of a pipeline requires the involvement of many parties, and the decision to approve or reject a pipeline project is made by the government based on its assessment of the project's safety and environmental impacts."}

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double pane window can be more energy efficient than a triple pane window if the gap between the two panes of glass is properly filled with an inert gas, such as argon or krypton. This gas filling can reduce heat transfer and improve the window's overall energy efficiency. However, the energy efficiency of a double pane window is often not as high as that of a triple pane window, as the additional pane and the gas filling add to the overall thickness of the window, which reduces its ability to transmit heat.\n\nOn the other hand, a single pane window can be more energy efficient than a double pane window if it is thermally broken or has low-e coating applied to the glass. Thermal break technology involves adding a small spacer between the two panes of glass, which reduces the amount of heat that can transfer through the window. A low-e coating is an invisible, metallic layer applied to the glass surface that reduces the amount of heat that can pass through it. Both of these technologies can improve the energy efficiency of a single pane window, making it comparable to or even more efficient than a double pane window."}

Kahane, in particular, saw this accommodation as a betrayal of the Jewish people and an abandonment of their history and traditions. He viewed this as a form of cultural assimilation that would ultimately lead to the erosion of Jewish identity. Fanon, on the other hand, saw this accommodation as a form of internalized oppression, in which the Jewish community became complicit in their own subjugation.\n\nBoth Kahane and Zizek were also critical of the American Jewish Establishment for its passivity in the face of rising anti-Semitism and white supremacy in the United States. Kahane, in particular, viewed this passivity as a form of collaboration with the oppressor, and he called for a more aggressive response to the growing threat of anti-Semitism. For his part, Zizek, in an interview with Democracy Now, echoed this sentiment, calling on the American Jewish community to become more politically engaged and active in resisting the rise of the far right.\n\nFinally, both Kahane and Zizek viewed the American Jewish Establishment's focus on universalism and equality as a form of delusion and self-betrayal. Kahane, in particular, saw universalism as a form of capitulation to the values of the dominant white culture, and he called for a more ethnocentric approach to Jewish identity and survival. For his part, Zizek, in his book Less than Nothing, also argues against the notion of universalism, calling it a fantasy that allows the powerful to maintain their dominance.\n\nIn conclusion, Kahane's ethics of violence echoes that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing the American Jewish Establishment in several ways. Both were critical of the Establishment for being too accommodating to the dominant white culture, for its passivity in the face of rising anti-Semitism and white supremacy, and for its focus on universalism and equality as a form of delusion and self-betrayal."}

Cantonese is a dialect of Chinese that is spoken by over 78 million people in the Guangdong province of China, and by people of Cantonese descent around the world. \n\nCantonese is a tonal language, meaning that the pitch and tone of a speaker's voice can change the meaning of a word. There are eight main tones in Cantonese, each associated with a specific word and meaning.\n\nThe Cantonese writing system is based on the Chinese writing system, and uses characters called hànyǔ pīnyīn to represent the sounds of the language. Cantonese also uses traditional and simplified characters, depending on the region or the preference of the writer.\n\nThe Cantonese language is known for its rich and diverse vocabulary, with many unique words and phrases that do not exist in Mandarin Chinese. Some examples include:\n\n- Gwai lo, which means \"foreigner\" in Cantonese, but can also be used as an insult to describe a white person.\n\n- Bai sik, which means \"white ghost,\" a slur used to describe white people.\n\n- Saam gwai, which means \"half-caste,\" used to describe people of mixed Asian and white ancestry.\n\nOverall, learning Cantonese is a rewarding experience that opens the door to a rich cultural heritage and a unique way of expressing oneself. I hope this introduction has piqued your interest in this fascinating language!"}

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type checking and class-based object-oriented features to the language. It is a cross-platform, open-source language developed by Microsoft and is compatible with JavaScript syntax.\n\nDuck Typing, on the other hand, is a programming paradigm in which the type of an object is determined by its behaviour, rather than its declared type. In other words, an object can be treated as any other object of a certain type if it has the expected set of methods or properties, regardless of what its actual type is. This concept is often used in dynamic languages like JavaScript, where type information is not explicitly declared.\n\nIn summary, TypeScript is a typed language that adds optional type checking and class-based object-oriented features to JavaScript, while Duck Typing is a programming paradigm that allows for looser typing where the type of an object is determined by its behaviour, rather than its declared type."}

{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are strong and lightweight fibers that are used in a variety of industries, including aerospace, automotive, and construction. In buildings, carbon fibers are used in structural components, such as reinforcements in concrete, as well as in external cladding systems. \n\nIn concrete construction, carbon fibers are added to improve the strength, stiffness, and ductility of the material. This results in stronger, lighter, and more sustainable structures. Carbon fibers are also used in post-tensioning systems, where they are embedded in the concrete and used to transfer tension from the structure to the reinforcement.\n\nIn external cladding systems, carbon fibers are used to create a lightweight and strong skin for buildings. These systems are typically composed of a polymer matrix reinforced with carbon fibers, which can be formed into 3D shapes. The result is a thin, yet highly-resistant, facade that can improve the energy efficiency of a building. \n\nIn summary, carbon fibers are used in buildings for structural reinforcement, in external cladding systems, and for improving the strength, stiffness, and ductility of concrete. They enable the creation of stronger, lighter, and more sustainable structures."}
{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "1. Limited access to land and natural resources: In Africa, agricultural land is often owned by individuals or communities, making it difficult for smallholders to access or purchase. Additionally, poor soil quality, climate change, and degradation limit crop yields.\n\n2. Lack of modern agricultural technology: There is a lack of access to modern agricultural technology, such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation, which hinders crop production.\n\n3. High costs of agricultural inputs: The cost of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers, can be high, further limiting crop production.\n\n4. Poor agricultural infrastructure: Africa has inadequate agricultural infrastructure, including poorly maintained roads, storage facilities, and processing plants, which affects the transportation and marketing of agricultural products.\n\n5. Lack of financial services: Low access to financial services, such as credit, insurance, and savings accounts, makes it difficult for farmers to invest in their farms or cope with unexpected events.\n\n6. Unpredictable weather: Weather patterns, including droughts and floods, are becoming more unpredictable, further affecting crop production.\n\n7. Lack of food processing and value addition: Most of Africa's agricultural production is still consumed locally, and there is a lack of food processing and value addition, which reduces returns to farmers and limits Africa’s ability to compete in international markets.\n\n8. Lack of rural development: Rural development is essential for the success of agricultural production, but many African countries lack adequate rural development programs, which limits economic opportunities for farmers and their families.\n\n9. Low agricultural productivity: Overall agricultural productivity in Africa is low compared to other regions, due to a combination of factors such as poor soil quality, limited access to technology, and inadequate investment in agriculture.\n\n10. High post-harvest losses: Poor infrastructure, lack of storage facilities, and inadequate processing techniques lead to high post-harvest losses, which reduces farmers’ income and increases food insecurity."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is a global issue that should be taken very seriously. It is a threat on a scale not seen before, and its effects are already being felt around the world. If left unchecked, it has the potential to disrupt global ecosystems, cause widespread flooding and drought, and put millions of people at risk.\n\nThe impacts of climate change vary depending on the region, but some of the most severe effects include:\n\n- Rising sea levels: Due to melting glaciers and ice caps, as well as thermal expansion of the oceans, the global sea level has risen by an average of 1.7 mm per year over the past 20 years. If this trend continues, coastal cities and low-lying areas could be flooded.\n\n- Changes in weather patterns: Climate change has already led to changes in the Earth's weather patterns, with more extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires. These events are expected to become more frequent and intense as the planet warms.\n\n- Disruption of ecosystems: Climate change has already had a devastating impact on ecosystems around the world, causing the loss of species, the degradation of habitats, and the disruption of natural cycles. If left unchecked, climate change could lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems.\n\n- Food security: Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on food production, with crop yields falling as temperatures rise. This could lead to food shortages and increased hunger in developing nations.\n\nIn summary, climate change is a threat that, if left unchecked, will have catastrophic consequences for the planet and its inhabitants. The good news is that there are many things that we can do to reduce our carbon footprint, and to adapt to the changes that are already happening. We must take action now, before it is too late."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "A feature length film typically lasts for an hour and a half to three hours, while a TV episode can range from 20 to 60 minutes. \n\nWhen watching a film, you have to mentally prepare yourself to invest that amount of time and attention to the story and characters. This can make it feel more taxing on your brain. On the other hand, when watching a TV episode, you are more likely to be drawn into the story right away and lose track of time, which can make it feel less effortful.\n\nAdditionally, in a TV series, episodes are usually self-contained and have a clear beginning, middle, and end, which makes it easier to process and remember the information presented. This can also make it feel like less of an investment of time and energy.\n\nIn summary, the reason why it feels like less effort to watch 3-hour long TV episodes back to back than a film, is because it requires less mental effort and effortful processing, and is more easily digestible in smaller chunks."}

Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "1. American Dream/Disillusionment: This motif is present throughout the story as characters express their desire to achieve the American Dream, only to find that it is not as easily attainable as they had assumed.\n\n2. Immigrant Experience: This motif is prevalent as the story explores the experience of immigrants in America, highlighting their struggles and triumphs as they adapt to a new culture and way of life.\n\n3.

These granulomas can form in almost any part of the body, but they most often affect the lungs, skin, eyes, and liver.\n\nThe cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body's immune system attacks its own cells and tissues. In people with sarcoidosis, the immune system makes a substance called granulomatous inflammation that forms the granulomas.\n\nSymptoms of sarcoidosis can vary and may include coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, skin rashes, and swelling of the eyes. In some cases, the disease may go away on its own, but in others, it can be chronic and cause lasting damage.\n\nThere is no cure for sarcoidosis, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. This may include medications, such as corticosteroids, to reduce inflammation, and sometimes, surgery to remove granulomas that are causing problems.\n\nOverall, sarcoidosis is a complex disease that can cause a variety of symptoms and can differ from person to person.

The 20-sided die is used to determine whether an attack is successful or not, but the number rolled on the die indicates the strength of the attack. So, if you roll a 20 on the die, your attack is a critical success, and if you roll a 1 on the die, your attack is a critical failure. The number rolled is added to your attack bonus to determine the final damage dealt.\n\nIn your case, you rolled a 24, so the damage would be 24 + your attack bonus, which would be 24 + (8 + Intelligence modifier) = 46 damage."}

The man will need to save $8000 - $2000 = $6000. If he can save $1000 each month, it will take him `n` months = (6000 / 1000) = 6 months to save up the required amount.\n\nThe second question is how much money he will have left over after buying the car. If he saves $6000, after `n` months he will have $8000 - $6000 = $2000 in his pocket. If he uses this money to buy the second-hand car, his old car will be left with a value of $2000 * (1 - (0.5% / 12) ^ (n)) after `n` months. So, his total savings after `n` months will be $2000 + $8000 = $10,000."}

Include claims on detailed processes involved, system architecture and algorithms", "answer": "1. Introduction:\n\nIn recent years, governments around the world have been exploring innovative ways to provide services to their citizens in a more efficient and convenient manner. One such area is the issuance of community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances.\n\n2. Brief Background: Community tax certificates, also known as property tax or land value tax, are levied by the local government on the value of land and buildings owned by an individual or business. These certificates are used to determine the amount of tax that an individual or business must pay to the local government. Other permits and clearances, such as business licenses or zoning approvals, are also required by the local government for the operation of certain businesses or activities. The issuance of these certificates and approvals typically involves multiple departments, agencies and authorities, with complex and time-consuming procedures.\n\n3. Problem Statement: The current process of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances is time-consuming, complex, and often requires physical presence or paperwork. There is a need for an innovative and efficient way of issuing these certificates and approvals that is accessible, convenient, and transparent for all stakeholders.\n\n4. Solution: In this solution, we propose an innovative and novel way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates. This is achieved using a combination of verifiable credentials, a digital wallet on a blockchain, and machine learning.\n\n5. Overview of the Solution: The solution involves the following key components:\n\na. Verifiable credentials: First, we use verifiable credentials to authenticate the identity of the applicant. These credentials, such as an Aadhaar number in India or a social security number in the US, are used to verify the applicant's identity and establish a digital footprint.\n\nb. Digital wallet on blockchain: Next, we use a digital wallet on a blockchain to store the community tax certificate and other relevant permits and clearances. This digital wallet provides a secure and immutable way of storing and distributing the certificates, while also ensuring the authenticity of the certificates.\n\nc. Machine learning: Finally, we use machine learning to analyze data from previous issuances of community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances. This helps to automate the approval process, reduce the need for human intervention, and speed up the issuance time.\n\n6. Process flow: Below is an overview of the process flow of the proposed solution:\n\na. Application submission: The applicant submits an application for a community tax certificate or other relevant permit or clearance through a digital platform. This application includes the required information and documentation, such as ownership details, building plans, or business license.\n\nb. Verification of credentials: The digital platform verifies the applicant's identity using their verifiable credentials. If the credentials are found to be invalid, the application is rejected.\n\nc. Certificate generation: If the verification is successful, the digital platform generates the community tax certificate or other relevant permit or clearance on the blockchain and stores it in the digital wallet.\n\nd. Payment processing: The payment for the certificate is processed using the digital wallet. This involves the collection of the applicable taxes or fees, which are then transferred to the local government.\n\ne. Notification and delivery: The platform notifies the applicant about the issuance of the certificate and provides them with a digital copy of it. The physical copy of the certificate is then delivered to the applicant's address through courier.\n\nf. Post-issuance monitoring: The platform uses machine learning to monitor the issuance of community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances. This helps to identify and address any potential issues or fraudulent behavior.\n\ng. Updates and enhancements: The solution is continuously enhanced and updated with new features and capabilities to provide a better and more efficient experience for applicants.\n\n7. Claims: \n- The proposed solution provides an innovative and efficient way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates, using verifiable credentials, a digital wallet on a blockchain, and machine learning.\n- The solution reduces the complexity and time associated with the issuance of community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances, making it more accessible, convenient, and transparent for all stakeholders.\n- The use of machine learning helps to automate the approval process, reduce the need for human intervention, and speed up the issuance time.\n- The digital wallet on"}
{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " [ [ ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( – [: ( for ( [ ( ( [ ( ( ( [ [ ( ( ( – ( ( (- - ( [ - ( ( ( ( of ( of of of [ of of of of of of of of [ of of ( [ of ( of ( ( ( of, [ s ( ( [ ( ( [ ( of [ ( ( [ [- ( ( ( [ [c ( ( ( ( [ ( of d of ( of of [( [ ( of our –( - (  ( ( - and – and people and,  – and – ( - [ ( of [ ( of of ( ( ( ( ( ( ( – ( [ ( ( ( of of ( of ( of ( of of of [?

The table would include a **name** and **id** column, and possibly additional columns for information like **email**, **password**, **role** and **status**.\n\n**Projects:** A table that stores information about the projects that are being tested using the test automation tool. The table would include a **name** and **id** column, and possibly additional columns for information like **description**, **start date**, **end date**, and **owner**.\n\n**Goals:** A table that stores information about the goals that are set for each project using the test automation tool. The table would include a **name** and **id** column, and possibly additional columns for information like **project_id**, **start date**, **end date**, **status**, and **description**.\n\n**Tests:** A table that stores information about the tests that are created for each goal using the test automation tool. The table would include a **name** and **id** column, and possibly additional columns for information like **goal_id**, **description**, **execution_count**, **status**, and **creation_date**.\n\n**Executions:** A table that stores information about the executions of tests for each goal using the test automation tool. The table would include a **name** and **id** column, and possibly additional columns for information like **test_id**, **start date**, **end date**, **status**, and **execution_count**.\n\n**Statuses:** A table that stores information about the various statuses that can be assigned to executions and tests using the test automation tool. The table would include a **name** and **id** column, and possibly additional columns for information like **status_name** and **color**.\n\n**Relationships:** A table that stores the relationships between the various entities in the data model. The table would include foreign keys for the relationships between tables.\n\nThis data model would enable the test automation tool to store and manage information about organizations, users, projects, goals, tests, executions and their statuses. It would also enable the tool to assign and track the statuses of executions and tests, and provide insights into the progress of projects and goals."}
{"id": "koala_179", "prompt": "How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table?", "answer": "To calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table, you will need to use the formula for the number of variations for n distinct objects taken k at a time, where n is the number of rows and k is the number of columns.\n\nThus, the formula is: (n!) / ((n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 3 (rows) and k = 4 (columns)\n\nThus, the total number of variations on a 3x4 table is: (3!) / ((3-4)!)\n\nThis simplifies to: (3 * 2 * 1) / (3 * 3 * 1)\n\nSo, the total number of variations on a 3x4 table is 3, or the number of distinct combinations of 3 objects taken 4 at a time."}
