{"id": "koala_8", "prompt": "Can you write a short story where Hildibrand Manderville somehow gets transformed into Gandalf the Grey and he must work with The Warrior of Light and Nashu to restore his regular, most gentlemanly form. ", "answer": "Hildibrand Manderville was a wizard, a good wizard, but a wizard none the less. He had spent many years learning the ways of the arcane arts, and through his studies had unlocked many secrets of the universe. He was a scholar and a gentle man, and was well respected throughout the kingdom.\n\nOne day, Hildibrand was called upon by the king to help solve a terrible mystery that was plaguing the land. A great evil was spreading through the land and the forces of darkness were growing in power. The king had heard of Hildibrand's great wisdom and asked him to use his knowledge to help defeat this great threat.\n\nHildibrand agreed and began to study the problem. He cast many spells and performed complex rituals in an attempt to understand what was happening and how to stop it.\n\nUnfortunately, his studies only led to more questions, and the problem continued to grow worse with each passing day.\n\nDesperate, Hildibrand went to the local library to seek answers in the great tomes of knowledge that were stored there. He searched for many hours, but still could find no answers in the ancient books.\n\nFrustrated and tired, Hildibrand sat down in a reading chair to take a break. As he sat there, he felt a strange tingling sensation throughout his body and suddenly he found himself to be no longer in the library, but in a vast and ancient city.\n\nHe was shocked to see that he was now in the physical form of a wizard from another time and place. He was no longer the scholarly man from the kingdom, but instead had taken the form of a tall, elderly wizard with a long white beard and flowing robes. He looked just like Gandalf the Grey from the stories he had read as a boy.\n\nHildibrand was shocked and knew that something must have gone terribly wrong with his spell casting. He had to find a way to return to his proper form before it was too late.\n\nHe began to search the city for some way to restore himself to his regular form. As he walked the crowded streets he saw many people living in great poverty and suffering. It was clear to Hildibrand that this was not a city of scholars and thinkers, but instead a place of great darkness and evil.\n\nHe was shocked to see that this place was the home of the Warrior of Light, a powerful being who he had often read about in the great tomes of lore. The Warrior of Light was being trained by a mysterious figure known only as \"The Guide.\" Hildibrand knew that if he could find this Guide, perhaps he could learn the secret of returning to his true form.\n\nHe began to follow the pair as they walked through the city, but they were always just out of reach. Hildibrand knew that he must act quickly before it was too late.\n\nAs he walked through the crowded streets, he saw a young boy running through the marketplace. The boy looked to be in great danger, as a dark figure was giving chase.\n\nHildibrand quickly stepped in front of the boy and stood between him and his pursuer. The menacing figure stopped and looked at Hildibrand in confusion.\n\n\"What do you want?\" the man asked.\n\nHildibrand looked at the man in disbelief. He clearly did not recognize him in his new form.\n\n\"I'm looking for the Guide,\" Hildibrand said. \"I need to speak with him as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe man laughed at Hildibrand's response.\n\n\"There is no Guide,\" the man said. \"There is only darkness and those who serve it. You, a mere wizard, have no place here. Leave this city before you suffer the same fate as the others.\"\n\nHildibrand was furious. He had come to this city to help defeat the darkness and now this man would not even let him speak to the Guide. He had to find a way to convince this man to let him pass.\n\n\"I will not leave until I have spoken with the Guide,\" Hildibrand said. \"I have information that may be of great value to you. If you will just let me speak with the Guide, I will impart this knowledge to you and you can decide for yourself if it is of value.\"\n\nThe man considered Hildibrand's words for a moment. Then, with a sigh, he agreed to let Hildibrand speak with the Guide. He lead Hildibrand through the crowded marketplace to a small building at the far end of the city.\n\nWhen they arrived"}

Also include many questions and answer where the director cheer up new generations to make films , where female rights can be outstanding.", "answer": "Film director : Its great to be here today and talk about women empowerment and the low number of female directors in the film industry.\nJournalist : Great to have you. So what according to you is the reason there are so few women directors in the film industry?\nFilm director : There are many reasons for that. Society has always put restrictions on the role of women. They've always told them to act in a certain way, behave in a certain way. Women have been taught to be submissive. So naturally when it comes to expressing oneself creatively, women find it hard to walk out of those restrictions and be themselves. And when they do, they are criticized and penalized. So, the number one reason is societal norms.\nJournalist : That's really sad. So what do you think can be done to encourage more women to come forward and become film directors?\nFilm director : I think the first step is to educate people. Society at large and people in general need to be educated about the importance of women's rights. How women are equal to men in every way. And they should be treated as equals. This needs to start from a very young age. Children need to be taught to respect women and treat them as equals. This will help break old and ingrained mindsets.\nJournalist : That's true. But what else can be done?\nFilm director : The film industry can also do its bit. There are many cases where women directors have been discriminated against. Their films have been passed without their consent. Their films have been cut without their consent. Their films have been promoted more for men than women. There are many cases where women have not been given their due. So the industry needs to change. It needs to give women directors the same opportunities as it gives to men.\nJournalist : Any suggestions on how it can be done?\nFilm director : There needs to be a collective effort. Not just by one person or a group. But everyone in the industry has to come together and change things. It needs to start from the bottom. New directors, male or female, need to be given a chance. Films can be produced by new people. Cinemas can be promoted by new people. Women can be given opportunities to do the same work as men. Only then things will improve.\nJournalist : That's very inspiring. So, you're saying women can do anything a man can do.\nFilm director : Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.\nJournalist : Thank you so much for taking out the time to chat with me today. It's been a pleasure talking to you.\nFilm director : You're welcome."}

One that has been asked and debated by scientists for years. The reason we consider protein, carbs and fat to have caloric value is because it was once believed that these macronutrients were the only sources of energy for our bodies. Additionally, the breakdown of protein, carbs and fat releases energy that can be harvested by the body. However, it's important to note that the amount of energy released during breakdown of macronutrients is not equal. For example, during the breakdown of protein, only 1-2% of the energy is released whereas during the breakdown of fat, ~9 kCal/g is released. Additionally, there are other macronutrients like alcohol which the body can use as an energy source but it is not considered a macronutrient as it is not required in large amounts for daily function. For the sake of simplicity, we include vitamins and minerals under the 'other electrolytes' category."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " in"}

As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.", "answer": "Hi,\n\nThank you for your detailed response. It's really appreciated that you took the time to personally respond to us. I hope you all are doing well and staying safe.\n\nI have a few follow-up questions, if you don't mind:\n\n1. What is the scope of the attack? Did the attacker get access to all Reddit user accounts, or just a subset?\n2. Can you share more details about how the attacker was able to phish a single employee? Was it a spear phishing campaign? What was the phishing email or website link that the employee clicked on?\n3. What does \"cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway\" mean?\n4. I'm curious about the business systems that the attacker gained access to. Can you share more details about what these systems are and what information the attacker might have accessed?\n\nThank you for your time and transparency. My family and I really appreciate it."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "  entity and theifying ialize  entity entity code line paragraph and guide topic paragraphial old pointer, the template guide plugin plugin related widgetialize"}

He looked up to see a large bird, a vulture of some kind, circling high above. It was then that he became aware of a presence at his back, and he turned to see a man standing there, a Jedi. The Jedi was an old man, with white hair and a long white beard. He was wearing simple robes, and he walked with a cane.\n\n“Welcome, Padawan,” the old man said. “I am Vos, a Jedi of the order, and I have been expecting you.”\n\n“Thank you, Master Vos,” Anakin replied. “I have come as instructed.”\n\n“Yes, I sensed that,” Vos said. “Come, let us sit and discuss your training.”\n\nAnakin walked over to a small table, and Vos sat down beside him.\n\n“Tell me, Padawan,” Vos said, “have you come to learn the ways of the Jedi, or the ways of the Sith?”\n\nAnakin stared at the old man, surprised by the question.\n\n“The ways of the Jedi, of course,” he said. “I have left the ways of the Sith behind me.”\n\n“Good,” Vos replied. “Then let us begin.”\n\nHe reached out and took Anakin’s hand in his own, and suddenly Anakin found himself transported to another world. He was no longer on Dagobah, but instead he was standing in a large, ornate room, with richly carved walls and floors. There were long, dark wooden tables, and on each table was a single candle, flickering in the air. At the far end of the room, in a large throne made of black marble, sat an old man with a long white beard. He was wearing a red robe embroidered with gold, and he had a golden lightsaber at his side. He looked up as Anakin entered, and a wide smile spread across his face.\n\n“Welcome, my young Padawan,” the man said. “I am Grakkus the Elder, and I am honored to meet you.”\n\nAnakin bowed low, his head touching the ground.\n\n“I am honored to meet you as well, Master Grakkus,” he said. “I am here to serve.”\n\nGrakkus laughed heartily at this.\n\n“Well said!” he exclaimed. “Well said! I like your spirit, my young Padawan. You have much to learn, but you have the potential for greatness. I can see it in your eyes. With the Force, you could be a powerful warrior indeed.”\n\nAnakin bowed again.\n\n“Thank you, Master Grakkus,” he said. “I accept your teachings with gratitude.”\n\n“Excellent,” Grakkus said. “Then we shall begin your training. First, however, I must give you a gift.”\n\nHe stood up from the throne and walked over to a shelf against the wall. From the shelf he took down a small container, and he held it out to Anakin.\n\n“This is a Jedi holocron,” Grakkus said. “It contains the knowledge of the Jedi order, and it is one of the most ancient artifacts in the galaxy. It will teach you everything you need to know about the Jedi, their history, their culture, and their way of life. It will be your guide as you travel the path of the Jedi. Take it with you, and keep it safe. Remember, above all, that a Jedi is a guardian of justice, and an instrument of the Force. This holocron will teach you to wield the Force as a Jedi should.”\n\nAnakin took the holocron from Grakkus and bowed his head in thanks.\n\n“I will take good care of it, Master Grakkus,” he said.\n\n“Excellent,” Grakkus said. “Now then, you have much to learn, and much time has passed since your last lesson. It is time for a refresher in the basics. Come, and let me teach you the ways of the Jedi.”\n\nHe led Anakin over to a large circular training area in the center of the room. In the center of the area was a small stone dais, and on the dais was a wooden sword, about a meter long, with a white blade. G"}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " of (cont of, of (gener, (course (near, (gener, (pr,, (follow of  of of  of of ( ( (, ( and of (do of  of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of  [gener of an of. of of of of of of of the of the  ( and ( ( ( or (dig (-h emb [cont and (special (c inn in (gen in [c (c (.

", "answer": "Even though I have only lived in these two places, Flagstaff, Arizona and Kaneohe, Hawaii, I have learned a lot about life by simply being a resident.  Actions speak louder than words and I have observed many actions from my fellow residents that have influenced my life in many ways.  I will discuss two of the most influential people and describe how their actions have impacted me.  The first person I will discuss is my mother.  She has taught me many things through her actions.  Her actions have taught me to be a loving person, to be honest, to work hard, and to believe in God.  Her first action that taught me to be a loving person happened when I was a young child.  I had a friend over to play and I wanted to show him my new toy, a light saber.  When I pulled it out, my friend was scared and ran away crying.  My mother explained that sometimes people show their true colors and that my friend was simply scared because he did not know me well enough yet.  Her second action that taught me to be honest was when I was in elementary school.  I was very young and did not understand the gravity of stealing.  I stole a candy bar from the store near our house.  My mom took me back to the store and made me apologize to the cashier and pay for the candy bar.  Her third action that taught me to work hard was more subtle but still very influential.  She showed me that hard work leads to success by simply being a hard-working person.  She wakes up early every day to go to work, to take care of us kids, and to do all the household chores.  Her final action that taught me to believe in God was through her own actions.  She would take us to church every Sunday and make us go to Sunday school.  Through her actions, she taught me to believe in God.  Her actions spoke louder than words and taught me many valuable lessons.  The second person I will discuss is my dad.  His actions have taught me many things as well, but they have taught me different lessons than my mom.  His first action that taught me a lesson was when I was in elementary school and I was bullied by another student.  My dad simply told me to ignore the other student and that words can hurt but they can also be forgotten.  His second action that taught me a lesson was when I was a teenager and I was getting ready to drive.  He said that I should drive slow and not speed because it is better to be late than to get a speeding ticket.  His third and final action that taught me a lesson was when I was a teenager as well.  My dad took me out to dinner and told me that I should always be polite and to treat women with respect.  His actions taught me many lessons and I will always remember them."}

We are going to work on a new tool you can use to help you in difficult situations.  One where you feel attacked, criticized, or on the receiving end of a strong emotion.  It is important to know that you are not responsible for other peoples emotions.  Their feelings are their responsibility.  However, you can control how you respond.  When you are in a conversation, and especially if you feel attacked or on the receiving end of a strong emotion, you can use a \"pause ritual\".  The pause ritual is a simple pause.  A conscious decision to take a breath, and allow time for you to gather your thoughts and feelings before responding.  The pause can be long or short, but the intention is to give you space to move from an instinctual reaction into a more intentional response."}

Our bodies convert this heat energy into useful energy for the body.  We need a certain amount of calories based on our activity level, age, and gender.  If we consume more calories than we use, we gain weight and storage of these extra calories as fat.  If we consume less calories than we use, we lose weight and use fat as an energy source.  Macronutrients come from foods that contain protein, carbohydrates, and fat.  Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals.  We need both macronutrients and micronutrients for proper body function.  A balanced diet that contains all the macronutrients and micronutrients in the right proportions is referred to as nutrition."}

This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "I would be happy to share with you some of my thoughts and ideas about the potential applicability of Krishnamurti's teachings to aikido. As you probably know, Krishnamurti rejected the role of the traditional teacher and recommended a form of learning that is radically different from the traditional one. In a typical aikido dojo, the Sensei is usually in charge of the class and gives instructions to the students. Usually, the students observe and execute the instructions. Krishnamurti suggested that we could invert this pattern: the students would come with a specific problem and the Sensei would help them to find their own answer by carefully guiding their inquiry but without giving any ready-made solution. The Sensei should act more as a mirror than as a teacher.\n\nIn aikido practice, there are many opportunities to apply this approach. For example, let's say that a student is struggling with a specific movement, like a particular kind of throw. The Sensei would help the student to observe what is going on during the throw and to simply describe what they see without any commentary. The Sensei should not try to interpret the movement or give any advice. After some time, the student might be able to articulate what is going wrong during the throw and might be able to find solutions by themselves.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is the role of the Sensei during the practice. In a traditional dojo, the Sensei gives instructions during the practice. In the framework we described above, the Sensei would not provide any instructions. However, the Sensei remains the center of the room and still acts as a model for the students. It would be interesting to consider what would happen if the Sensei stopped giving instructions and started acting more like a mirror. Would the students be able to rely on their own inner teacher?\n\nI hope that these thoughts are helpful to you and that you will be able to apply some of these ideas in your practice."}

meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "The energy efficiency of a window can be calculated using the following formula:\nEnergy Efficiency = (1-U Value) * (1/R Value)\nwhere R Value is the insulation value of the glass and the U value is the value of the window frame.\n\nIn most climates, double pane windows have an energy efficiency of around 0.25 to 0.30, while triple pane windows are around 0.35 to 0.40. So a triple pane windows is more efficient than a double pane windows. \n\nIn some climates, it can be more efficient to use single pane windows than double pane windows. This is because double pane windows with argon gas filling has an energy efficiency of around 0.25 to 0.30, while single pane windows with krypton gas filling has an energy efficiency of around 0.35 to 0.40.\n\nThe reason for this is that gas filling has a thermal conductivity of around 0.025 to 0.030 w/m-k, while the glass has a thermal conductivity of around 0.08 to 0.10 w/m-k. So by having a single pane window, we are actually increasing the thermal insulation of the window.\n\nSupport your answer with appropriate calculations."}

The key to overcoming the challenges is to recognize when you are in the Rats Trap and get out of it.  When you are in the Trap, focus on the Rats.  But when you get out of the Trap and see the Elephant, then focus on the Elephant.  This will allow you to see the larger systemic challenges and change them."}

It is caused by humans burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases prevent heat from leaving the planet, causing temperatures to increase. \n\nThere are several ways that climate change can harm humans. Warmer temperatures can increase the risk of heat strokes. More intense storms and rainfall can cause flooding and damage. Droughts can lead to crop failures and water shortages. Climate change can also harm wildlife and habitats, causing species to go extinct. \n\nThe best way to stop climate change is to stop burning fossil fuels. This can be done by using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. We can also conserve energy by turning off lights and electronics when not in use, taking shorter showers, and driving more efficient cars. \n\nEveryone can take action to help stop climate change. By reducing our carbon footprint, we can help prevent the harmful effects of climate change and protect the environment for future generations."}

Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115).

The American Dream/Disillusionment motif is present because the author shows how Ugwu's family and friends in Nigeria believe that by moving to America, Ugwu will achieve a better life and life goals.  The Nigeria/Africa motif is present because Ugwu is leaving his country in Africa to go to America, thus establishing the idea that the story takes place in Africa and that Ugwu is going to America.  The Gender/Womanhood motif is present because Ugwu's wife, Oluchi, is a strong woman who is able to navigate the male-dominated fish market and keep her family together."}

{"id": "koala_166", "prompt": "Explain sarcoidosis to me like I’m a five year old", "answer": "Sarcoidosis is an immune system disease that causes small clusters of inflammatory cells to form in the body's tissues. The immune system is a complex network of cells and molecules that work together to protect the body from infections. In people with sarcoidosis, the immune system goes into overdrive and forms these lesions in different areas of the body. \n\nCommon areas for these lesions to form are in the lungs, skin, or eyes. However, they can form almost anywhere in the body. Sometimes, these lesions can cause issues like shortness of breath, skin rashes, or vision problems. The good news is that most of these lesions will go away on their own or with treatment. But sometimes, the disease can continue to cause issues in the body, even with treatment. This is why it's important to get properly diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. \n\nSarcoidosis is most common in people between 20 and 40 years old, but it can affect people of all ages. While it is more common in people from Northern European descent, it can affect people of all ethnicities. There is no known cause or clear way to prevent sarcoidosis.

If he can save $1000 per month, it will take 60 months (5 years) to save up the remaining $6000.\n\nHowever, if he can only save $1000 / (1.05) = $917 per month, then it will take 66 months (5 years and 6 months) to save up the remaining $6000."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " of of of of of of of of of ( of ( of ( of of ( ( ( ( ( [ of ( t ( that ( ( [ ( ( of [ of ( of ( ( ( ( [ of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( or of ( of of of of or of ( and of of ( ( of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of of ( of of ( ( of [ ( ( ( ( of and ( [ ( of of, ( of ( of of of of of of of of of ( n, of and ( ( ( ( [ ( ( of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of ( ( ( ( [ of ( of ( of ( ( of of of of of ( of ( ( ( of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of and of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of: if of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of or of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of n h ( ( ( ( of ( of of of of of ( of ( ( ( ( [ [ C [ [ [ [ ( [od [ [ [ ; [- of of of of of of of of of [- and of and and and and and and and and ( of ( and of of of of of ( of of of of of ( of or ( c ( or ( ( ( and ( [ ( ( ( of ( of of a ( of ( of ( ( of and in ( ( (- ( ( b ' ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( or of and (( (- ( - ( ( ( c ( ( ( [ as cl l ( and (, ( as d [ at [ ( of ( ( do ( b ( ( or ( ( or or (, or d ( and and and and (, th of ( ( ( of ( ( “ ( d ( ( and ( ( ( l ( ( ( of ( of ( ( ( and ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( s t ( and of of of of of a of [ ( in and of either have in ( of and and ( of ( ( or and of ( ( or [ or ( of of of of ( ( of of of of of of of of and ( [ ‘(, en “ [( [ ( ( ( ( ( of ( of of of of of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of [( t of of of of of of of of of  ( t ( (( ( ( d [h ( or ( ( and [h and and, ( and ( or ( d da - ( ( j ( ( [ of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of or of of of of of ch and ( and of [ and dry for of of and of f on w( do of and d ( ( [ ( d c ( [( of in ( and of or of “ of of and of of ( of de d of c of in [, or ( in ( ( ( ( [ of [( ( of of of of of of of of a of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of de of of of ( that of, ( and of that for ( of “ of ( of t ( and of of of of of of of of of of d of ( of of s of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( “ ( of [ ( of of of of of of of and of of of of ( ( ( of de ( ( of ( and ( P ( B ( ( of ( of of of of"}
