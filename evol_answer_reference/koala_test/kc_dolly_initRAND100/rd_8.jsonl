{"id": "koala_8", "prompt": "Can you write a short story where Hildibrand Manderville somehow gets transformed into Gandalf the Grey and he must work with The Warrior of Light and Nashu to restore his regular, most gentlemanly form. ", "answer": "Once upon a time there was a very affable wizard named Hildibrand Manderville.  He lived in a large manor in the countryside and was very popular with the peasants and townsfolk of the surrounding area for his kindness, generosity, and magical abilities.  One day, while on a walk through the nearby forest, Hildibrand became lost.  The sun was nearly setting and he was becoming quite concerned that he would not be able to find his way back to his manor before nightfall.  As he continued to wander, he became more and more disoriented and began to lose hope that he would ever find his way back to safety.  He stopped to rest on a large tree stump and was just about to resume his search when a bright light shone down from the sky.  As Hildibrand looked up, he saw a large, glowing, eye-like orb plummeting towards him.  The orb landed on the tree stump directly in front of him and burst apart, revealing a large staff at the center.  The staff began to glow brightly and Hildibrand found himself suddenly enveloped in a wave of power.  As the energy subsided, Hildibrand found himself transformed into a much more imposing figure with grey hair and beard, wearing robes of brilliant gold.   He also discovered that he was now holding the staff in his right hand.  Hildibrand looked down at his new form with some confusion and uncertainty.  He had no idea what had just happened, but he did know that he now had the power to return to his manor.  He also knew that he needed to find the owner of the staff and return it to them.  With renewed determination, Hildibrand set off in the direction of his manor.  As he walked, he began to feel more and more confident in his new abilities.  He discovered that he was much stronger and could move much more quickly than he ever could before.  He also found himself more and more adept at sensing the supernatural forces around him, and discovered that he could even command these forces and manipulate the very fabric of reality itself.  As Hildibrand continued to walk, the sun began to set and he realized that he would not be able to make it back to his manor before nightfall.  He found a large, flat rock beside the path and sat down to rest for the night.  As Hildibrand sat there, he noticed that the surrounding area seemed somehow familiar.  He also noticed that the rock he was sitting on seemed to be glowing with an otherworldly light.  Before he could ponder this any further, he was startled when a hooded figure stepped out of the shadows and sat down beside him.  Hildibrand was startled by how close the stranger had come without him noticing.  The figure was tall and slender with long, flowing robes and a staff in his left hand.  Hildibrand was also surprised to see that the stranger was clearly female, as her form was very curvaceous and voluptuous.  Hildibrand was about to ask the woman who she was and how she got there when she spoke.\n\n“I am the Warrior of Light, child of the light, and I have come to test you.”  The woman said in a deep, yet melodic voice.  “Through the power of this staff and the light within you, I can now see your true form.  I can see that you are a kind and gentle soul, and that you were once a man of great power.  But now, you have been stripped of that power and are nothing more than a frail mortal.  You have been chosen by destiny to serve as my champion, to wield this staff and protect those who cannot protect themselves.  You have been chosen by destiny to become Gandalf Greyhame.”  The woman said with a smile.  Hildibrand was completely confused, but he knew that this woman was not lying to him.  He bowed his head in acceptance of his new fate.  As he did, the staff in his hand began to glow even brighter than before and he was overwhelmed with a sense of power and confidence.  He stood up and looked directly into the woman’s eyes.  She was still wearing her hood, so he could not see her face, but he could sense her joy and happiness at his decision.  “Rise, child of the light, and take up your new mantle.  You will be known as Gandalf Greyhame, and you will be a beacon of hope to those in need.”  The woman"}

Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates all contain energy-yielding units called calories. However, a calorie of protein or fat is not the same as a calorie of carbohydrate.\n\n1 gram of protein or fat contains 9 calories, but 1 gram of carbohydrate contains 4 calories. This is because a molecule of carbohydrate (e.g., a sugar) contains fewer calories than the same weight of protein or fat (mostly because of the structure of the molecules).\n\nSome foods contain other compounds with fewer calories, such as water and fiber. Fiber, for example, is found in plant foods, and it is not considered an energy-yielding substance because the body does not metabolize it.

{"id": "koala_25", "prompt": "Write me a 2000 word essay on a water safety engineering project.", "answer": "Water safety is a pressing issue that affects millions of people across the world.  In the United States alone, an estimated 10 people die each day from unintentional drowning (CDC, 2019).  Although drowning is the fifth leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United States, it is the second leading cause of death for children between the ages of 1 and 4.  Drowning can occur in as little as an inch of water in a bucket or a swimming pool.  Children under the age of 5 have the highest drowning rates as they are naturally curious and have not yet developed the physical and emotional maturity required to assess and mitigate risks.  Parents and caregivers therefore play a critical role in ensuring water safety for children.  Below are some steps parents/caregivers can take to ensure water safety:\n\n1. Enroll your child in water safety courses such as swimming lessons or water survival training.  These courses will teach children key water safety skills such as how to swim, how to float and tread water, and how to exit a pool or body of water in the event of an emergency. \n2. Install and use a fence around all four sides of the pool and secure the gate.  This will prevent children from gaining access to the pool unsupervised. \n3. Provide constant adult supervision around water.  Even children who are strong swimmers can drown.  They may also forget to use their swimming skills and get into trouble. \n4. Ensure life jackets are properly fitted for the child and are worn at all times when in or around water.  \n5. Avoid using air-filled or foam pool toys such as water balloons and water rings.  These toys can deflate and pose a choking hazard. \n6. Avoid using inflatable swimming aids such as water wings and noodles.  These aids can give children a false sense of security which can lead to loss of supervision and increased risk of drowning. \n7. Avoid using alcohol or drugs prior to engaging in water activities.  These substances impair judgment and increase the risk of drowning.\n\nAlthough water safety is a parent/caregiver responsibility, it is important to remember that no one can watch a child 100% of the time.  Drowning can occur in the blink of an eye, so it is important for everyone to take steps to ensure water safety.  By following the steps outlined above, you can help reduce the risk of drowning and ensure your children have fun in the water while staying safe."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": ". c... and.h and t at and and to and stess s, and, and and and as in b (un and, in \"t, in my. me of in my b in b to al., to to to to to to to to to in and my of our of of of of and of my (at (p to.

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information.

Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " \n ify-forming code andics ices onifies codes  terior codefaces andificists andifies toxicifies ives ifying theifies icalizes"}

{"id": "koala_66", "prompt": "explain the basics of area and perimeter", "answer": "In geometry, the area of a surface is a measure of the \"extent\" or \"size\" of a two-dimensional region, or a surface, bounded by a closed curve (i.e. a region enclosed by a curve). It is an integral of the square of the distance function from a fixed reference point, measured along the boundary of the region. The boundary is commonly a curve, though it may be a surface. The region can be a square, rectangle, circle, triangle, or any other arbitrary shape.\n\nIn Euclidean space, the area of a region is a property of the region itself and is independent of the chosen coordinate system. However, in non-Euclidean geometry the concept of area is model-dependent.\n\nIn the case of a plane, the surface area of a two-dimensional region is the sum of the areas of its bounding square. In the case of a sphere, the surface area is the number of square units (i.e., square meters or square feet) of its surface.\n\nThe area of a three-dimensional region is the surface area of its bounding surface, which has three dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular prism is the sum of the products of the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism's six faces.\n\nIn computer graphics, the term \"polygon area\" is often used to refer to the area of a polygon."}

He was here to meet a Jedi Master named Polis Massa. He had been informed by the Jedi Order that he would be receiving advanced training in the Force from this Master.\n\nAnakin strode through the crowd, ignoring the many people who looked askance at him. He was used to stares, and not just because of his height, but because he was a young human male from the desert world of Tatooine.\n\nAt last he reached the building where Master Massa was located, and he requested entry. A droid-servant ushered him to an elevator, and the two rose to the Master's floor. The droid-servant opened the door, and Anakin stepped inside.\n\nHe was surprised to see an ornate parlor, with a long, polished table in the middle of the room, and several comfortable chairs and sofas. A polite message-droid stood at attention by the table.\n\nAnakin crossed the room and approached the droid, and spoke. \"Polis Massa, to see you.\"\n\nThe droid responded, \"Master Massa will see you now, Anakin.\"\n\nThe message-droid turned and walked to the far wall, and a door opened. Anakin followed, and was surprised to see a slender man in a long, flowing robe, with a flowing beard and long, flowing hair.\n\n\"Anakin Skywalker,\" said the man, \"please have a seat.\"\n\nAnakin sat down, and the man said, \"You have been told of my training methods, Anakin?\"\n\nAnakin replied, \"Yes, Master Massa. You teach me to use the Force through meditation and contemplation.\"\n\nThe man chuckled. \"Yes, that is one way, Anakin. But I teach you through the use of the lightsaber. That is my way.\"\n\nAnakin was confused. \"But Master Massa, the Jedi are forbidden to use the lightsaber. It is too dangerous.\"\n\nThe man smiled. \"Yes, Anakin, that is what the Jedi have always taught. But the Jedi are wrong. The lightsaber is a powerful weapon, but it is only dangerous in the hands of a fool.\"\n\nAnakin felt his eyes widen. \"Master Massa, what do you mean?\"\n\nThe man smiled again. \"Anakin, there was a time when the Jedi were at war with the Sith. The Sith were dark side users, and they wanted to rule the galaxy, and use the Force for their own ends. They were very powerful, and even the Jedi feared them. But the Jedi had a secret weapon. They had discovered how to harness the power of the lightsaber. Thus, the Jedi could face the Sith in battle, and because the Sith were weak in the light side of the Force, they would lose. The Jedi had the strength of the light side, and the skill of the lightsaber. The Sith were no match.\"\n\nAnakin nodded. \"So the Jedi were always right, and the Sith were always wrong. And now the Jedi have become the Sith.\"\n\nThe man's smile widened. \"You are very quick with the Force, Anakin. The Jedi have indeed become the Sith. And when I was a Jedi, I was one of them. I fought in the war against the Sith, and I used the lightsaber. And I killed.\"\n\nAnakin gasped. \"You killed? A Jedi never kills?\"\n\nThe man responded, \"The Jedi were wrong then. They are wrong now. The Sith are not so strong. I have learned the truth of the Force, and I have trained you so that you will learn it as well.\"\n\nAnakin felt his head spinning. \"What do you mean? What is the truth of the Force?\"\n\nThe man stood and walked over to the table. He picked up a hilt, and a beam of light shot out, and then formed into a double-bladed lightsaber.

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": "c, [reg, [c, \"s, topic, eng, either, near, [(inf, (s [context of ([c and [co the, or (in of (of (in of the of of of of of of of the nu, (c or -in of, (d (of of ([gener of (contr of (c of [supp ((c and the (s [h (for the [specific (C (h (h (f (N [subject, (gener (p, [C, the, the, the the, [c, the, and, (d, (f, the, (in, and, the (th, and, and (in, of, of [H of of,.in, and, and, and, and, and subject, dine of of the.

They channel the pool of savings in the economy to those who want to invest and, at the same time, channel the flow of funds from those who invest to those who are in need of capital for their business ventures. Through these markets and institutions, savers can diversify their risk by investing in a variety of financial instruments across different asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and other debt instruments, insurance, and different forms of money. Investors, in turn, can obtain funds to finance their businesses with a degree of certainty about the return on their investments. The price of these instruments is driven by the underlying risk of the investments and investors' expectations about future changes in the economy.\n\nFinancial markets and institutions play a vital role in allocating funds efficiently across the economy and providing reliable information about the economic prospects of businesses.

When you find yourself feeling emotionally reactive to another person, I recommend using a pause ritual to help you gain some space and perspective.  The first step is to pause and take a few deep breaths.  This will help you to center yourself and reduce any physiological arousal that may be occurring.  Next, I would recommend that you try to describe your emotional state using a single word.  This will help you to gain some additional insight into your feelings and how they may be impacting your behavior.  Finally, I would encourage you to consider how you might like to respond to the situation.  This is where you can choose to implement your pause ritual again by taking another few deep breaths and considering the possible responses that could be most helpful to you in the moment.  These could include choosing to take a time out, speaking with the other person to better understand their perspective, or asking the other person to give you some space so that you can collect your thoughts.  By using a pause ritual, you can gain some much needed space and perspective to help you respond in a more thoughtful and intentional way."}

In other words, a backlink is a link from one website to another website.  In most cases, web pages link to other web pages because they contain valuable content that is related to the page being linked to.  For example, a blog post about SEO might link to a page that explains what SEO is.  The blog post about SEO is providing value to its readers by linking to another webpage that also provides value to the readers.  This is why backlinks are important for SEO.\n\nSearch engines like Google and Bing use a web page's backlinks as a signal to determine the importance or authority of a web page.  A web page that has many backlinks from other high-quality websites is considered to be an important page.  Search engines use this information to determine how to rank that page in their search results.  For example, if a web page ranks for a keyword, then the search engines will look at the backlinks to that page to see if it is a high-quality page that should be ranked higher in the search results.  If the page does not have many backlinks from other high-quality websites, then the search engines will determine that the page is not as important as other pages that do have many backlinks.\n\nBacklinks are valuable for SEO because they are used by search engines as a signal to determine the importance of a page.

We have two industries, B2B SaaS and Ecommerce. Within SaaS, we are used by customer success teams. Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application. Come up with a couple of ideas where Churned and Ocean can join forces, which we can use in the application\n", "answer": "Churned and Ocean could join forces to develop a solution that allows customers to predict and prevent churn. The solution would use Churned's SaaS solution and Ocean's predictive analytics capabilities. By combining both solutions, we would be able to predict churn and provide the customer with the insights and actions to prevent it."}

{"id": "koala_117", "prompt": "Write a snoopdogg rap explaining how to not commit a warcrime", "answer": "First things first, you need to know the difference between a war crime and a war atrocity. War crimes are violations of the laws and customs of war committed by a party to a conflict. War atrocities, on the other hand, are violations of the laws and customs of war committed by a non-state actor, or a non-state actor who is not part of a party to a conflict. In 2005, the International Task Force on Intervention and State Sovereignty, an independent body established by the United Nations, clarified that the term \"war atrocity\" \"should be understood to include both war crimes and other serious violations of the laws and customs of war.\" The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which came into force in 2002, defines as war crimes \"grave breaches\" of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and \"any other serious violation of the laws and customs of war.\"\n\nNow that we're all on the same page, let's get into the rap.\n\n1. The first thing you need to do is determine if you are a party to a conflict, or a non-state actor. If you are a party to a conflict, then you committed a war crime. If you are a non-state actor, then you committed a war atrocity.\n2. Determine if you are a member of the US military, or a civilian contractor with the US military. If you are a member of the US military, then you committed a war crime. If you are a civilian contractor with the US military, then you committed a war atrocity.\n3. Next, you need to determine if you are targeting a civilian or a military target. If you are targeting a civilian, then you committed a war crime. If you are targeting a military target, then you committed a war atrocity.\n4.

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "The first question the teacher needs to ask himself is: Is the purpose of my aikido practice to develop myself as a person, or to become a good aikidoka? Personally, I believe that both are important, but I would never separate the two. If the purpose is to become a good aikidoka, then the teacher needs to guide the student towards the technical perfection. This is his responsibility. If the purpose is to develop myself as a person, then the teacher needs to guide the student towards self-realization. This is the students responsibility. Of course, it is not possible to separate these two completely, because in any moment we are the student and we are the teacher, and in every moment we are developing ourselves as a person and we are becoming a good aikidoka. But at least we know which direction we want to go. This is the most important thing. So the teacher need to communicate to the student where he wants to take him. The teacher, as any other person, has his preferences, his history, his culture, his personal experience. And these will always influence his communication. So the teacher need to be aware of this, and have enough honesty to communicate his preferences, while at the same time being open to listen to the student preferences. Because the student has his own preferences, and these preferences might be different from the teachers preferences. If both of them are committed to this practice, it is essential to listen to each other and find a way to communicate their preferences to each other. This is not easy, but it is possible. And this is the main challenge in teaching aikido. To be able to communicate your preferences to the student and at the same time listen to the student preferences without judging them. Because if the teacher judges the students preferences, then that means that he is not open to listen to the students preferences, and this will not create the ground for communication. So if the teacher does not judge the students preferences, then he needs to be honest with himself and communicate his own preferences clearly. Because after all, this is what the student is looking for. Because the student is looking for a teacher, and the teacher is somebody who can communicate his preferences to the student, so that the student can decide what to do with those preferences. The teacher is not there to impose his preferences, but to communicate them. And the student is not there to reject the teachers preferences, but to learn from them and decide if this is something he wants to do. So, in summary, the teacher needs to be clear about his preferences, communicate them clearly to the student, and at the same time be open to listen to the students preferences, without judging them. The student needs to be honest with himself and with the teacher, and communicate his preferences clearly to the teacher, without judging the teachers preferences. And this is the path of communication. And this is the way to teach aikido."}

{"id": "koala_128", "prompt": "Need 300 words on the importance to documenting history in relation to the future", "answer": "All over the world, we are witnessing a rise in nationalism and extremism. Politicians are increasingly using divisive tactics to garner support, and there is a growing sense of mistrust between people of different ideological and religious backgrounds. In such a climate, it is important that we remember our history, and learn from the lessons of the past. This is especially true for the younger generation, who are often more vulnerable to misinformation and propaganda.\n\nBy studying and understanding the past, we can better understand the present. This can be especially valuable when it comes to learning about the atrocities committed by certain governments and regimes in the past. Documenting and teaching history is therefore crucial for ensuring that such events are never repeated. It is also important to remember that history is written by the victors, and does not always accurately reflect the experiences of those who are marginalized or oppressed. By including multiple perspectives in our history lessons, we can better understand the different experiences of different groups of people.\n\nBy studying and understanding history, we can better understand the present. This can help us to be more empathetic and understanding of those who have a different background or set of beliefs than us.

businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

The initiative was launched at the 10th AU Extraordinary Summit held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The AU committed to ease restrictions on the movement of airplanes between African countries, with a view to creating a single African sky and market for air services.\n\nTo date, 24 out of 54 AU member states have signed the agreement. However, only 11 countries are fully compliant with the agreement.\n\nAfrican countries are working to improve connectivity by improving their airports and introducing new technologies. They are also working with international partners to expand existing initiatives, such as the African Airlines Association (AFRAA)’s “50 by 2025” initiative, which aims to expand aviation traffic to 50 million passengers within the next decade and the “10-year Aviation Vision for Africa” of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).\n\nSeveral African countries are also members of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Aviation Cooperation initiative, which aims to promote global cooperation in the field of aviation. The goal of this initiative is to improve global aviation connectivity and strengthen the global aviation system, in order to support economic development.\n\nMembers of the WEF’s Global Aviation Cooperation initiative include the African Union Commission, the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), the African Airlines Association (AFRAA), the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the World Bank, the World Customs Organization (WCO), and the WEF.\n\nFinally, several initiatives are being implemented to facilitate the development of the aviation industry and strengthen connectivity in Africa. These include:\n\n- The African Aviation Safety and Oversight (AASO) Programme, which aims to improve aviation safety and oversight in Africa through the setting up of a harmonised safety oversight system.\n\n- The Africa Air Safety Centre (AASC), which was established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to monitor and analyse safety trends in African civil aviation.\n\n- The African Aviation Cooperation (AFAC), which is an ICAO initiative aimed at strengthening aviation cooperation among African states.\n\n- The Africa IDF (Airport Identifier Data File), which is a database of airport codes used in Africa.\n\n- The Single African Sky (SAS), which aims to harmonize airspace management and air traffic control (ATC) services across Africa."}

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript and Duck Typing are programming concepts that are used in many languages.  In TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript, static type safety is provided.  This means that a developer knows at compile-time what type a variable or parameter is.  For example, if a function parameter is declared as `string`, the developer knows that the function only accepts strings and cannot be used with other types such as numbers.\n\nDuck Typing is the other concept in which the type of a variable or parameter is not checked at compile-time but rather at run-time.  Duck Typing is often seen as a \"loose typing\" compared to strong typing.  In Duck Typing, a function can be called with any type and the type of the incoming value is used at runtime.  For example, a function that takes a string argument can also be called with an integer value.  At runtime, the function will check that the argument is a string and will throw an error if it is not."}

The book is filled with helpful examples and stories of organizations that have successfully applied the concepts of the flywheel to create change and improve performance.  The book is highly recommended for individuals and organizations looking to create change and improve performance."}
{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are used in buildings as a material for reinforcement, as well as for other structural parts. Carbon fibers are used in buildings because of the high strength-to-weight ratio of the material, as well as the ability to tailor the material's properties by changing the chemical and/or textile properties of the fibers. \n\nCarbon fibers are used in reinforcing materials for concrete or other construction materials. In this use, the fibers are bound together to make a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) material (such as fiber-reinforced plastic). The reinforcement material improves the strength and resilience of the concrete or other material.\n\nCarbon fibers are also used to make structural components for buildings. These components are often made of carbon fiber composites, a material made of a polymer matrix reinforced with carbon fiber. Examples of structural components made of carbon fiber composites include beams and columns."}
{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "1. Increasing population growth: By 2050, more than 2 billion people will be added to the current population of Africa, and half of them will be young people aged between 15 and 24.\n2. Declining arable land: Africa has 60% of the world's uncultivable land. This means that only 12% of the arable land is suitable for agriculture.\n3. Depletion of freshwater resources: 40% of Africa's freshwater is used for agriculture. This percentage is expected to increase significantly in the coming years.\n4. Climate change: Africa is the continent most affected by climate change. This is an additional challenge to agriculture, which is already facing water scarcity and degradation of soils.\n5. Lack of modern inputs: Africa has the least amount of fertilizers and pesticides per hectare.\n6. Lack of mechanization: Agriculture accounts for 80% of the labor force in Africa and this percentage is expected to increase in the coming years, although mechanization can alleviate this pressure.\n7. Lack of access to markets: More than 70% of food produced in Africa is wasted and this is mainly due to the lack of adequate storage and marketing facilities.\n8. Lack of education and training: In Africa, only 10% of agricultural research is devoted to crop breeding and less than 1% of public investment in agriculture is allocated to agricultural research.\n9. Lack of investment: Africa has the least amount of public and private investment in agriculture among all continents."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is the long-term change in the Earth's climate, or its patterns of weather. The term climate change is often used to describe changes in the modern climate.\n\nThe Earth's average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 ºF (1.1 ºC) over the past century, with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980. The warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and scientists are more than 90% certain that it is primarily caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity (mainly fossil fuel burning and deforestation).\n\nScientists project that without substantial and sustained global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the global average temperature increase could reach up to 11.5 ºF (6.4 ºC) by 2100, leading to more droughts, floods, and severe weather. These changes would harm ecosystems and wildlife and disrupt social systems and economies around the world.\n\nA number of countries and regions have already set non-binding targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Some countries have set binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol. To keep global temperature rise this century well below 2 ºC (3.6 ºF) and to pursue efforts to keep it below 1.5 ºC (2.7 ºF), humanity will need to rapidly and dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. The next few decades are critical. To have any chance of meeting these goals, global greenhouse gas emissions would need to start falling by 2020, and emissions would need to go to zero by 2050.\n\nThere is no one solution to halt climate change. Rather, many actions are needed simultaneously. It is important to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. At the same time, we need to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to counteract the effects of past emissions. Lastly, we need to adapt to the impacts of the climate change that is already unavoidable. All nations, developed and developing, must work together to develop solutions to this global problem."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "Films usually have a 90 minute run time while most TV episodes have a 43 minute run time.  When watching 3 films back to back, you are only watching for a total of 9 hours.  If you watch 3 3-hour long TV episodes back to back, you are watching for a total of 6 hours.  Since you are watching for the same amount of time, you may think that it would be the same amount of effort.  But in actuality, you are using more energy to watch the films than the TV episodes.  Each individual TV episode is broken up into smaller chunks which requires less energy to consume than the films.  This results in feeling like less effort to watch the TV episodes."}
{"id": "koala_162", "prompt": "Findings from Jumping Monkey Hill (Story #1)\nPlease respond to the following questions/prompts below. Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.\n\nWhat were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "In addition to the American Dream/Disillusionment motif, I would identify the following two: \n\nExpatriation/Nostalgia motif: \"You have been away so long, you have changed so much, and now you are coming back. What will they say when they see you? You will have to tell them your own story, about how you have been changed by America, by your education and your work and your life\" (Adichie 117). \n\nExplanation:This supports the Expatriation/Nostalgia motif because it expresses how the narrator feels about returning to Nigeria after many years living in America. She describes the challenges she anticipates will arise when she returns home, such as how her own life experiences over the years will contrast with the expectations of her extended family and friends.\n\nFutility/Vanity motif: \"Your friend says, this is how it is in Nigeria: you must know someone who knows someone to get anything done. It is a small country, he says. You say, yes, but it is a big world. He says, yes, but this is Africa. You say, yes, but we are in America. He says, yes, but this is Nigeria. You say, yes, but we are on a college campus\" (Adichie 118). \n\nExplanation:This supports the Futility/Vanity motif because it expresses the narrator's frustration over her friend's assertion that in Nigeria, the only way to get anything done or accomplished is by knowing somebody who knows somebody else. She argues that America is a big country and that the world is a big place, and that this is not the case everywhere, including in Nigeria."}

{"id": "koala_166", "prompt": "Explain sarcoidosis to me like I’m a five year old", "answer": "Sarcoidosis is a disease that causes little lumps of inflammation to form in different parts of the body.  The cause of the disease is unknown, but it is thought to be related to an overactive immune response.  These lumps that form are called granulomas, and they can form in different organs in the body, such as the lungs, liver, or skin.  \n\nSome people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms at all, while others will have symptoms related to the body part that the granulomas are forming in.  For example, if they are in the lungs, a person might have a cough or shortness of breath.  If they are in the skin, a person might have a rash or red bumps.  Doctors often diagnose sarcoidosis based on the appearance of these granulomas during a biopsy.\n\nSarcoidosis can go away on its own, but some people will have it for many years.  There is no cure for the disease, but there are treatments that can help with the symptoms."}

{"id": "koala_168", "prompt": "write a chronology of important events related to ESG in 2022", "answer": "2022 was a landmark year for environment, social and governance (ESG), with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) coming into effect in January, and the Paris Agreement (agreement on climate change mitigation) entering into force in November.\n\nIn January, the 17 SDGs were adopted by all 193 member states of the United Nations (UN), marking the start of a 15-year global plan to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. The SDGs aim to address global challenges such as poverty, hunger, gender equality, climate change, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice. The goals are interdependent, with no single solution able to achieve all of them, and success will require action from all stakeholders across global, national and local levels.\n\nIn March, the European Union (EU) adopted its first ever Sustainable Finance Action Plan, which sets out measures to integrate sustainability considerations into the Union's economy and society. The action plan aims to ensure that the financial system plays a catalytic role in supporting the transition towards a sustainable, circular, and resource-efficient economy.\n\nIn April, the World Bank published its first ever \"Doing Business\" report on \"Trading Across Borders\", which measures the complexity and cost of trade-related regulatory procedures in 190 countries. The report highlighted the steps that governments can take to reduce the administrative burden of cross-border trade and make it easier to do business internationally.\n\nIn May, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) launched the first ever Global Assessment Report on risk finance, which identified major gaps in funding for disaster risk management (DRM) and called on governments, the private sector, and international financial institutions to step up investment. The report warned that global investment in DRM is estimated at less than half of what is needed to effectively reduce disaster risk, and that investment in low-income countries is only 2% of what is needed.\n\nIn June, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its first annual report on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD), which assessed the implementation and uptake of the recommendations made by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. The report found that more than 70% of the world's largest companies have disclosed some climate-related financial information, with the highest level of disclosure occurring in Europe and North America.\n\nIn September, the EU published its first ever Sustainable Finance Roadmap for mainstreaming sustainability across the financial system. The roadmap sets out actions aimed at integrating sustainability considerations into the EU's economy, with a focus on boosting investments in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement, transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and promoting economic growth that is inclusive, resilient, and sustainable.\n\nIn November, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) published its annual report on progress towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement, which found that global greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2019 for the first time since 2014, driven by higher emissions from the energy, transport, and agriculture sectors. The report warned that rapid and far-reaching actions are needed to put the world on track to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goals, with current national commitments not sufficient to reach the central goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nIn December, the UNFCCC published its latest comprehensive assessment of climate action, which found that global emissions are still rising, and that the gap between current emissions and the level required to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goal is widening. The report warned that the window of opportunity for limiting global warming to 1.5°C is closing fast, with only five years left until 2030 for carbon emissions to peak.\n\n2023 will be another landmark year for ESG, with the UN Sustainable Development Goals coming into effect and the Paris Agreement entering into force."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " (f in [(c ((Cug (p (ne [C [this ([C (((do [F (( [ve (ne c -- and (c ((([m ( (–of of of of of of — of of of [of of of of of our of and of, (c-c, (c (t (c (c of (t (((c [(c out, [-h of (of (ne of (N of the of [c of [P of our – ((c –e –(I it [s or it [(s (ne – (de of of ( of (N (-tr?

{"id": "koala_179", "prompt": "How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table?", "answer": "Variations on a 3x4 table is a combinatorial problem. In other words, you are trying to count how many unique arrangements of 3 items can be put in a 3x4 grid. The number of arrangements are calculated by using the multiplication rule for counting. In this case, the rule states that the number of arrangements of n items in a k-dimensional space is nk. In our example, there are 3 items and a 4-dimensional space, so the number of arrangements is 3x4 = 12."}
