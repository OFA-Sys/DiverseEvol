{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Bank's main business is to borrow money from the public and lend to borrowers, the money lent by the bank is called a loan. The borrowers take a loan to finance their projects, like buying a home or starting a business. Bank earns a fee or interest on the loan it gives to the borrowers. The borrower has to pay back the principal and interest to the bank.\n\nThe loan given by the bank is always less than the actual amount needed by the borrowers. The borrower has to pay the difference between the amount borrowed and the amount actually required to complete the project. This is called the margin money or down payment. Banks also requires the borrower to have an insurance policy to protect the lender's interest in case the borrower defaults on the loan.\n\nThe lending by the bank is a risky proposition as the borrower may default on the loan. In case of a default, the bank has to take back the loan amount from the borrower and also recover the interest or fee it has earned. The bank may lose money if the sale of the asset does not fetch the full amount of the loan.\n\nBank's capital is the money the bank has set aside to absorb potential losses. The bank is required to maintain a minimum level of capital, called the minimum capital requirement or regulatory capital. The banks are allowed to use the capital as a buffer to absorb losses in case the bank faces a shortfall in its income. If the bank's capital falls below the minimum requirement, the bank will be considered insolvent and may be closed by the regulators.\n\nCash is a liability for the bank as it has to pay interest to the depositor. Cash cannot be used as capital as it cannot be used to absorb losses."}

{"id": "koala_6", "prompt": "Can you tell my a story about nuclear physics like dr Seuss?", "answer": "The sun gives off a lot of energy, and that energy makes the earth warm. Some of that energy is in the form of light, and some of it is in the form of other particles called photons. Photons are tiny, and their mass is almost exactly zero. We say they have no mass, so they move at the speed of light, which is the maximum possible speed for anything, even particles. Even though they move at the speed of light, those photons have a lot of energy. Some photons have enough energy that if you were to catch one, it would knock electrons out of the atoms it hit. The atoms would become ions, and the ions would give off more light, as the electrons danced around in orbits closer to the nucleus. This is actually what happens when the sunlight hits the Earth. The sun gives off photons which strike the Earth, and some of those photons knock electrons out of atoms. The electrons then rebound to lower orbits. This releases energy in the form of the light we see from the sun. It is so much energy released that it feels hot. The sun emits a lot of photons, and some of them hit our skin. The photons have no mass, so they go right through our skin and into our bodies. The photons are moving so fast that they knock electrons off of atoms in our bodies, and when they rebound those electrons give off more light. It's the photons that hit our skin that keep us warm."}

He had heard of a rumor that a wizard had been spotted in the Northern Highlands, and he was determined to find this wizard and ask for some of the wonders of magic.  As Hildibrand ventured through the wilderness, he soon found himself in a small clearing.  He was greeted by a man in plain clothing who said, \"Welcome to the Wizards Tower my friend, I am Gandalf, a great wizard and I have some questions for you.\"  Hildibrand was overjoyed by this meeting.  He had been a fan of Gandalf since he was a little boy, and he could not believe he was actually speaking with the great wizard himself!  Gandalf then asked Hildibrand what his name was, and he replied, \"Hildibrand Manderville, but my friends call me Brandy.\"  Gandalf then asked Brandy how he had come to be in the wizards tower, and he replied, \"I was on my way to see a wizard when I came across this clearing and found you.  I was wondering if you could help me with a small problem I am having.\"  Gandalf, curious about what the problem may be, asked Brandy to tell him about it.  Brandy then explained to Gandalf that he had been transformed into a ragged, old, grey-haired man who smelled of smoke, and that he needed Gandalf's help to return to his former self.  Gandalf, who was no stranger to the art of magic, told Brandy that he would need to undergo a ritual to reverse the spell that had been cast upon him.  He explained that the ritual would be difficult, as it had been many years since anyone had performed it, and that most of the spell books and tomes of magic had been lost in the War of the Rings.  Gandalf then asked Brandy if he had ever performed the ritual before, to which Brandy replied that he had not.  Gandalf then told Brandy that he would need to find his way to a place called the Chamber of the Warrior of Light in the city of Nashu to perform the ritual.  He explained that the Warrior of Light was a great wizard in his own right, and that he could assist Brandy in completing the ritual.  Brandy was overjoyed at the prospect of returning to his former self, and agreed to complete the quest.  He thanked Gandalf for his help, and Gandalf bid him farewell.  Brandy then gathered his things and headed off into the great wilderness of Gielinor."}

If you are interested in neuroscience I would suggest looking at projects on the Neurodata Without Borders website, which is a community repository of datasets and analysis tools for neuroscience. If you are interested in computational neuroscience, you could also look at publicly available datasets, for example the Allen Brain Atlas or the Human Connectome Project.

{"id": "koala_14", "prompt": "Instaknow Inc. has developed a highly unique, patented real-time process automation platform, the Instaknow-ACE r (Active Collaboration Engine). Instaknow-ACE implements the SOA and BPM capabilities in a radically advanced manner, using \"Non-intrusive Model Driven Architecture (n-MDA)\". Once the composite choreographic business solution is modeled using friendly graphical interfaces, the model becomes the live operational solution, without needing additional programming and without costly XML modifications to existing applications. By avoiding programming costs in the composite layer and eliminating the need for XML programming changes to all other systems, n-MDA materializes the \"Agile Enterprise\" benefits of SOA and BPM without the major expense, time and risk of heavily programmed, intrusive deployments. Extensive discussions with other system owners about XML formats and standards are avoided because Instaknow-ACE can do real-time interactions with any other application without XML, using patented \"non-intrusive interaction\" technology advances. Instaknow's \"No Change to Existing Systems\" process automation approach results in avoidance of huge amount of technical analysis, design, coding, testing efforts and costs, freeing up technology staff and budgets to deliver other new, strategically valuable business systems. An operation that can respond quickly to changing business requirements, automate and empower decision-making, create real time collaboration across the enterprise and the Web, while leveraging existing systems, can now be achieved with minimal resources and investment.\nWhat can be inner working model of this company?", "answer": "The business process workflows are modeled and orchestrated in the Instaknow-ACE r (Active Collaboration Engine) using the Instaknow-ACM (Automation Composite Modeler) and Instaknow-EVM (Extended Visual Modeler) graphical toolkits.

The effect is that the 'carbohydrates' get turned into energy (kCal) and the body then stores the remaining glucose as glycogen.\n\n'Proteins' are broken down into amino acids, which the body then uses to create new proteins. This causes a build-up of amino acids in the body, which are then discarded as waste. This process does not create energy (kCal) in the body.\n\n'Fats' are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, which the body then uses as fuel. The effect is that the 'fats' get turned into energy (kCal) and the body then stores the remaining fatty acids as fat for later use.\n\n'Vitamins, minerals and other electrolytes' do not get broken down into any other substances by the body. Instead, the body absorbs them and they are used for various metabolic processes. The end result is that there is no net energy (kCal) gained from them."}

Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness.

This article shares some common rules that will improve the performance of instance segmentation AP metric.\n\n1. Segmenting single object instances: For single object instances, it is usually easy to find the bounding box that contains the instance. For example, the bounding box for the cow in the attached figure is the green rectangle. In this case, it is easy to find the bounding box for each cow, and just segment each cow with its bounding box. Note that for images with multiple objects, we usually don't want to segment each object individually, as that would be too time consuming. Instead, we usually want to segment the bounding boxes of each object instance.\n2. Segmenting multiple objects in the same bounding box: For bounding boxes that contain multiple objects, we usually want to segment each object individually. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if the bounding box contains multiple cows, we still want to segment each cow individually. The reason for this is that cows are usually far away from each other, and it is hard for a CNN model to distinguish cows that are far away from each other. So, for bounding boxes with multiple objects that are close to each other, we usually want to segment each object individually."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": ".a in. and.. and of a., and as m in to over. 2 and and (and.. and in and (c in an and and and at un-sh, b at s and and and, d (st to to to to to to to to to and and and and and of of of of of of of (at. and, and and (in and,... and. of of of (c of of st of of and. d in and to and (at and and (c (b j in ((h (� and non re-d (a..ing.c in (sm st, and, in (re..,, sh,,,, as (h in re.

People with an ideological mindset refuse to recognize the logical implications of their own beliefs, and will instead embrace any conclusion that is consistent with their beliefs, no matter how irrational or implausible that conclusion might be.  For example, a person who believes that the government should be run like a business might refuse to acknowledge the many ways in which the two systems are actually very different, and might instead support a policy or a candidate simply because it is consistent with their belief that businesses are inherently more efficient and effective than the government."}

Blogs are typically hosted by a third-party service, and users can set up a free blog in a matter of minutes. Blogs are often used by individuals to share thoughts, ideas, and opinions with the world, but can also be used for business purposes. For example, a business may use a blog to promote its products and services.\n\nSocial networking sites are another type of social media technology that allow users to create profiles that are then displayed to other users of the site. Users can then connect with one another, and often upload photos and videos to share with each other. The most popular social networking sites are Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.\n\nVirtual social worlds are another type of social media technology that allow users to interact with each other in a virtual environment. Many people use virtual social worlds to play games with other users. A popular example of a virtual social world is Second Life, which is a 3D virtual world platform where users can interact with each other in a virtual environment. Virtual social worlds are also used for business purposes, such as for holding virtual meetings and conferences.\n\nVirtual game worlds are another type of social media technology. Virtual game worlds are similar to virtual social worlds, but are used for playing games rather than for interacting with other users.

He argues that there are many variables in the economy which are not priced into the price of a stock, so the price of the stock is not an accurate representation of the value of the stock.  There are too many variables, and humans can't predict the future, therefore it's impossible for humans to be efficient at predicting the price of stocks, which means markets are not efficient.  Therefore, he says, you should invest in assets which are uncorrelated to the market, such as assets which derive their value from a physical asset, like gold or oil."}

{"id": "koala_40", "prompt": "Tell me something I don’t know", "answer": "While it is not a popularly used term, there is a distinction between the terms “hate crime” and “bias crime.” Hate crime refers to a crime that is motivated by bias against a victim’s race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion, or other personal characteristics. Bias crime refers to a crime that is motivated by prejudice against the victim based on these characteristics. \nIn 2018, the FBI reported 7,120 hate crimes in the United States. Of those, 59.6% were motivated by race and ethnicity, 21.1% by religion, 16.7% by sexual orientation, 3% by disability, and 2.1% by gender identity. \n\nWhile the FBI does not track bias crimes, other estimates suggest that the number of bias crimes in the United States is much higher.

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager!

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "  program ices  [ ical 1 2 words 1 10 icesphere code 1 1. ictives igerization  theifies andici "}

He turned around to see a mysterious figure carved into the stone, and a strange green light began to emanate from the stone. Dagur called out to the strange figure, and the light moved away from the stone and revealed the figure to be an elf. The mysterious elf said he had seen what had happened, and he offered to help Dagur escape if he would swear an oath of brotherhood. Dagur agreed, and the mysterious elf helped him escape from his cell.\n\nDagur and the mysterious elf continued to work together, and they managed to free all of the prisoners in the dungeon. The prisoners were grateful to Dagur and they swore an oath of brotherhood to him. Dagur decided to lead the prisoners to the nearest town so they could regroup and form a band of adventurers. The mysterious elf accompanied Dagur as he led the prisoners out of the dungeon, and Dagur swore an oath of brotherhood to the mysterious elf as well. However, as the prisoners were leaving the dungeon Dagur heard a strange voice speaking to him. The voice told Dagur that the mysterious elf was not who he claimed to be, and that he would betray Dagur and the other prisoners. The mysterious elf overheard the voice as well, and he quickly left the dungeon behind.\n\nDagur and the other prisoners followed the mysterious elf to a nearby town. However, when they arrived in the town Dagur found the mysterious elf had already formed a band of adventurers and he was not interested in joining them. Dagur and the other prisoners decided to stay in the town and form their own band of adventurers. They decided to call themselves the \"Forgotten Heroes\" and they soon became well known throughout the region for their exploits.\n\nDagur's adventuring career was a long and storied one. He and the Forgotten Heroes fought many foes over the years, including orcs, gnolls, and giants. They also explored many dangerous dungeons and caves, and they even battled many evil dragons. Dagur became one of the most renowned heroes in the region, and he eventually retired from adventuring to become a ranger in his own right. He settled down in a small village where he lived a quiet life with his wife and his child."}

The brain is a very powerful organ, and it's job is to keep you alive. When you get depressed, the brain is trying to keep you alive, but in a way that doesn't feel good. It's trying to protect you, but it's doing it in a way that feels like the end of the world. So, it makes you want to end the world, because that's the only way it knows how to keep you alive.

It is illegal because there is no law that specifically allows gambling, while there are laws that specifically prohibit gambling in India. However, it is argued that the online gambling law does not apply to foreign operators or remote gambling. It is therefore legal for a player to play at an online casino owned and operated by a company based in a foreign country. The interpretation of the law is different in different states. In some states, such as Sikkim, online gambling is allowed with a government license, while in other states such as Maharashtra, it is illegal."}

As a photographer, I am always looking for new and unique perspectives to capture images from. My first week in Spain, I was drawn to the architecture of the buildings and churches. I did not realize that this was the first indication that I was going to be inspired by the art of photography. The next week, I was walking around the city and I saw a group of people lined up for a procession. As the procession started, I saw the beautiful light coming from the candles and it lit up the entire scene. I immediately pulled out my camera, but I was too late, the scene was gone. Even though I did not capture the moment, it inspired me to think about how I could capture the light from a candle in a different way. The next day, I was walking through the park and I saw these trees that had been hit by a storm. The light was reflecting off the leaves and it was beautiful. At this point, I knew exactly what I wanted to capture. I wanted to capture the light reflecting off of the leaves to create a unique image. I spent the next few days trying to capture this image and I finally got the shot that I wanted. The process was challenging because I had to keep moving around the tree to capture the light from different angles. I was very happy with the results and I realized that I had been inspired by the art of photography."}

These protocols act as a layer on top of the underlying blockchain, providing interoperability between different services and standardization of certain aspects of the financial instrument. DeFi protocols are often built as a set of smart contracts that can be implemented on top of any blockchain. The protocols are then used to create and trade financial instruments by services that run on top of the protocol, called DeFi applications. Some of the most popular DeFi protocols are Synthetix, Bancor, Compound, and dYdX.\n\nDeFi protocols are usually categorized into three layers based on their functionality: the protocol layer, the institutional layer, and the application layer. The protocol layer (Layer 3) provides standards for specific use cases such as decentralized exchanges, debt markets, derivatives, and on-chain asset management.

Ledger, Polychain Capital, and Aeternity are examples of protocols in this layer.\n\nFinally, the application layer (Layer 1) provides end-user services like crypto lending and deposits. The popular Coinbase wallet and the OpenBank Project are examples of applications in this layer."}
{"id": "koala_73", "prompt": "How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from?", "answer": "Money goes from your pocket to the stock market when you sell something you own, like a house or car, for example.  The proceeds are called \"cash in hand.\"  You can then buy stock in a company, which you do by giving the stockbroker your cash in hand.  He then takes the money, buys the stock for you, and then gives you a share of the company as evidence of your ownership.\n\nInvestors buy and sell stock all the time, and the stock market is where this happens.  When you buy and sell stock, you are actually buying and selling ownership of the company.  So when you buy stock in a company, you are actually buying a share of the company.  And when you sell a stock, you are selling your ownership of the company.  As an example, say you own 100 shares of stock in a company and you want to sell those shares.  If the stock is trading at $100 a share then you have $10,000 in proceeds from selling your stock.  You could then take that money and go buy a house, but you could also take that money and buy 10 more shares of that same stock, which would give you a total of 200 shares of that stock, or 2%.  When you own 2% of a company, you are a \"small\" investor.  When you own 50% of a company you are a \"large\" investor.  When you own 100% of a company, you are the owner of the company.  So as you can see, money comes from your pocket, through the stock market, and back to your pocket when you sell a stock."}

It is a form of computational mechanics whereby a problem is divided into many smaller parts called finite elements. These elements may be triangles, quadrilaterals, or other polygons in two-dimensional problems, or three-dimensional tetrahedra and other polyhedra in three-dimensional problems. The stiffness and/or mass properties of the elements are typically assumed to be known and do not vary across the elements. \n\nThe nodes of the elements are connected by elements called springs or beams. These virtual elements can be connected in different ways depending on the type of problem being solved. The purpose of the virtual components is to approximate the behavior of the actual components of the problem. For example, a spring is used to approximate a force or a torque, or a beam to approximate a force. The forces and stresses in the approximating components are then calculated based on the known stiffness and the known loading. \n\nThe FEM is a variation of the finite difference method whereby the problem domain is subdivided into a mesh of elements. In contrast to the finite difference method, the FEM is a technique for solving partial differential equations, while the finite difference method is used for solving ordinary differential equations."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all.

{"id": "koala_86", "prompt": "when are hops added to the brewing process?", "answer": "Hops are added to the brewing process at several different times depending on the type of beer being made. In general, bittering hops are added at the beginning of the process to add bitterness.  Aroma hops are then typically added late in the process to add aroma and flavor to the beer. After the beer has fermented, some beers are dry hopped. This is where the beer is transferred to a secondary fermenter and fresh hops are added to the beer to give it a fresh hop aroma."}

It is the highest city in the state of Arizona. People who live or visit Flagstaff for a period of time often say they feel more energetic and less sluggish at this elevation.  Flagstaff is located in a natural bowl surrounded by mountains. This creates a \"dry\" climate with clean air. People often say the air in Flagstaff smells \"fresher\" than in other cities. There are many opportunities to enjoy the outdoors in Flagstaff. Hiking and biking trails crisscross the city and the surrounding mountains. In the winter, snow-covered mountains are in sight from many parts of the city. Skiing at the Snowbowl ski area is popular with both residents and visitors. The city is less than an hour from the Grand Canyon, one of the world's most famous landmarks. \n\nFlagstaff has a small-town feel. The city population is just over 70,000, but many people who live in the area commute to larger cities such as Phoenix, Tucson, or Albuquerque for work. Flagstaff is a college town, and home to Northern Arizona University. The university is located in the center of the city, and many of the students contribute to the local culture and nightlife. There are many restaurants and coffee shops in the city that feature live music and local art. Flagstaff has a vibrant theater and arts scene, with plays and musicals produced by the local community theater. \n\nFlagstaff draws visitors from across the country and around the world. Many people come to enjoy the outdoors. Others come to visit the Historic Downtown area, with its many art galleries, cafes, and shops. The city also hosts a variety of festivals throughout the year. \n\nWhile Flagstaff has many similarities to other cities in the United States, it also has a distinct culture and character.

{"id": "koala_96", "prompt": "assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual", "answer": "Hi there, let's say you find yourself in a conversation with someone who is quite pushy and aggressive. You may react immediately in a way that is defensive or aggressive yourself.  In the spirit of being non-reactive, it would be good to first take a few deep breaths, and remind yourself that the other person has likely had a rough day, or is feeling a bit anxious or stressed themselves.  You might also want to consider the source of their pushiness or aggression, is it coming from a place of love, or is it coming from fear?  In any case, it's good to remember that they are a human being, just like you, and that they have likely experienced pain and suffering in their own life.  Once you have a sense of compassion for them, you can then use the pause ritual.  What that means is that you take a few moments to pause and breathe before you respond.  The pause gives you the opportunity to pause and reflect on what they just said, and whether it is true for you.  If it is, then it is okay to acknowledge that, but you may want to do so in a way that is non-aggressive or defensive.  If what they said is not true for you, then you may want to respond with a statement that is aligned with your values, but in a way that is gentle and non-judgemental.  For example, if they say to you \"You're not doing a good job\", you may respond with \"I know that right now it may feel like I'm not doing a good job, and that's okay.  I'm going through a difficult time right now, and I'm doing the best that I can.  I appreciate you letting me know what's on your mind\".  This is an example of how you can use the pause ritual to be less reactive, and instead respond with kindness and compassion."}

{"id": "koala_99", "prompt": "Write an article about the site's backlink and its importance\"Use the following keywords in the article Questions Others Asked\nWhat is a backlink example?\nWhat are SEO backlinks?\nDo backlinks help SEO?\nHow do I get backlinks?\"", "answer": "A backlink is a hyperlink that directs traffic to your website. The most common type of backlink is a hyperlink from another website to your website. For example, this Wikipedia article about backlinks includes many hyperlinks to other articles on Wikipedia and to other websites. The hyperlinks from other websites to your website are called backlinks because they are going \"back\" to your website.\n\nSearch engines, such as Google, use backlinks to help determine the quality and authority of a website. The more high-quality, relevant backlinks a website has, the higher it is likely to appear in search results. For example, if you search for \"Italian restaurants\" on Google, the results will likely include a list of Italian restaurants with links that you can click to visit their websites. These restaurants likely have high-quality backlinks from other websites because the content on these other websites is relevant to the Italian restaurant industry and the restaurants have a history of providing excellent customer service. High-quality backlinks from authoritative websites are a sign to Google that the Italian restaurants being linked to are also likely to be of high quality.\n\nAnother reason why search engines, such as Google, value backlinks is because they are the internet equivalent of a citation or reference. Websites often link to other websites when they mention or discuss information from those other websites. For example, this article about backlinks includes a number of hyperlinks to other Wikipedia articles and to other websites. When other websites link to this article about backlinks, it is like someone citing this article in a research paper. This shows that this article is a reliable source of information about backlinks.\n\nSearch engines take into account many factors when deciding where to rank a website in search results, but backlinks from other websites are one of the most important factors. Backlinks from high-quality, relevant websites are especially important. Search engines also look for patterns in where backlinks are coming from. For example, if a large number of backlinks from other websites all point to a single page on your website, this may be a sign that the content on that page is not as relevant as the rest of your website.\n\nThe overall goal of building backlinks is to get your website to rank higher in search results. This may sound like a lot of work, but there are many ways to build backlinks to your website naturally. For example, you can write and submit articles to other websites. When you write and submit an article, you can include a link to your website in the \"resource\" section of the article. There are also many companies that offer backlink-building services, but these services often use unethical or \"black hat\" SEO techniques that can get your website penalized by search engines, such as Google. Avoid using these services and use only natural, white-hat SEO techniques to build backlinks to your website."}

Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract?", "answer": "There are two ways to do this:\n1. First, you can create a presale contract for your investors, and then after the end of the presale raise the funds and open the launchpad contract\n2. Second, you can create a single contract that includes both functions. However, in this case, when creating the presale contract, you need to make sure that the total amount of tokens you want to raise in the presale is less than the total number of tokens you want to distribute in the launchpad. The reason for this is that if you raise more than the total number of tokens you want to distribute in the launchpad in the presale, then the launchpad will not be able to distribute all of the tokens to investors."}

A \"2.5D\" game, where the world is on a 2D plane, but you have sprites (such as enemies) that move and act as if they are \"floating\" above the world.\n3. A \"side scroller\", where the characters move from the left to the right, and the world is on a 2D plane.\n4. A \"platformer\", where the characters can jump, and must navigate obstacles and climb platforms to reach the end of the level.\n5. A \"shooter\", where the characters have weapons and must navigate and shoot enemies along the way.\n6. A \"simulation\" game, where the characters interact with each other and the world based on the rules of the game.\n\nThere are many other types of games as well, and each one can be implemented in Godot using a different combination of the above. The key is to think about how the game world works, and how the characters interact with it. Once you have that figured out, it is easy to create a game in Godot."}

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

This includes the logical design of the system, and the physical implementation of the system in a form that is understandable to a designer or manufacturer. Computer architecture, on the other hand, refers to the logical design of the processor, or central processing unit (CPU), which is the element that performs the majority of the calculations in the system. This includes the description of the instruction set and the organization of hardware resources such as registers, memory, and I/Os.

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "I am not a teacher, but I have some thoughts based on my own experience with both aikido and Krishnamurti's teachings. As I understand it, Krishnamurti's teachings are based on the realization of the fact that the self or ego does not exist and that we mistake our thoughts about the world for the world itself. This is not to say that our thoughts are not real, just that they are not the world. In the context of aikido, I think it would be important to keep this in mind when we are teaching or practicing. We may think that we are teaching or practicing aikido when in fact we are just having thoughts about the way we think aikido should be practiced. If our goal is to improve our aikido, then we should be very careful that our thoughts do not become the goal. Our goal in aikido should not be to have better techniques or to master the art but to explore the question of what is true and what is not true. Our goal should be to learn to see clearly and to let go of everything we think we know.\n\nIn my experience, this is very hard to do and it requires a lot of patience and discipline. It is very easy to get caught up in the thinking that we are doing aikido and to forget that our goal is actually to go beyond the thinking about what aikido is. This is where the teacher or uke can play an important role. The teacher or uke can help by gently pointing out when we are lost in our thinking and reminding us of our original goal. The teacher or uke can also help us by not giving us the answers we are looking for. This is often very hard for aikido students because we want to learn from the teacher and we want to do what they say. However, when the teacher gives us the answer we are looking for, we will never learn anything. Instead, we will just be reinforcing our belief in the existence of the self or ego.\n\nThis is where I think aikido and Krishnamurti's teachings can be very similar. Both aikido and Krishnamurti's teachings are based on the idea that the self or ego does not exist and that we mistake our thoughts about the world for the world itself. This is not to say that our thoughts are not real, just that they are not the world. In aikido, the teacher or uke can act as a mirror, reflecting back to us our own thoughts and beliefs about ourselves and the world. We may think that we are aikido practitioners, but the teacher or uke can help us see that we are just having thoughts about aikido. In the same way, Krishnamurti's teachings can act as a mirror, reflecting back to us our own thoughts and beliefs about ourselves and the world. We may think that we are following Krishnamurti's teachings, but the teachings can help us see that we are just having thoughts about Krishnamurti's teachings."}

{"id": "koala_127", "prompt": "write a detailed business plan for fatherhood training based on Dwayne Meeks book Pieces never missing in a childs life", "answer": "Fatherhood training or fatherhood development refers to any program designed to increase positive father involvement in their children's lives. In practice, fatherhood training is usually offered as a voluntary program, sometimes as part of a wider social or family support program. In general, fatherhood training focuses on providing practical information and advice to fathers, with the aim of enhancing their parenting skills and involvement with their children.\n\nFatherhood training programs typically offer a range of services and activities, including:\n\n* Information and advice about fathering\n* Workshops on topics such as communication, discipline, and support networks\n* Group activities such as sporting events, social gatherings, and outings\n* One-on-one mentoring and coaching\n* Father-child activities\n* Assistance with access and visitation rights (when applicable)\n\nFatherhood training programs are often delivered in community centers, youth centers, and other community locations, although they may also be offered in a range of other settings, including prisons, hospitals, and schools.\n\nFatherhood training is sometimes delivered in partnership with other organizations. For example, fatherhood training may be offered in collaboration with government agencies, non-governmental organizations, community groups, schools, and employers.\n\nFatherhood training has the potential to benefit both fathers and their children. Father involvement is associated with a wide range of positive outcomes for children, including improved academic performance, better mental health, and reduced risk of delinquency and substance use. In contrast, father absence is associated with a range of negative outcomes for children, including increased risk of behavioral problems, emotional difficulties, and poor social adjustment.\n\nDespite the potential benefits of fatherhood training, to date, there is limited empirical evidence about its effectiveness. The few studies that have been conducted tend to find mixed or small effects on father involvement and child outcomes. This may be due to a variety of factors, such as the quality and duration of the training, the fathers participating in the program, and the characteristics of the children.\n\nKey challenges for fatherhood training programs include encouraging fathers to participate, particularly those who are most in need of support. Many fatherhood training programs also face shortages of trained staff and resources."}
{"id": "koala_128", "prompt": "Need 300 words on the importance to documenting history in relation to the future", "answer": "For the history to be valuable in the future, it needs to be documented. The documentation needs to be permanent and accessible. It also needs to be complete and accurate. If any of these conditions are not met then the history is not useful for the future.\n\nBy documenting the history you are preserving it for the future. This is important because many people assume that the present will continue into the future. They don't think about what will change or what will be lost. By recording what happened in the past you are preserving it for the future. This helps people to understand how the world has changed over time. It helps them understand the decisions that were made and the reasoning behind them.\n\nIf the history is not documented then it is lost. This is a huge loss because people will not be able to learn from the past. They will not be able to understand how the world has changed. They will not be able to understand the decisions that were made and why. This leaves them in the dark about what has happened and what choices they have in the future.\n\nAs the saying goes \"Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it\". If history is not documented and accessible then people will not learn from it. They will not understand how the past has shaped the present. This leaves the door open for people to repeat the same mistakes that were made in the past."}

{"id": "koala_133", "prompt": "Why did the building of a pipeline have to be voted on by the government(USA)? Doesn't this infringe on government interfering with private corporations?<br>", "answer": "The building of a pipeline typically crosses through some form of public land, whether it is federal, state, or local. The government has a vested interest in protecting the environment and ensuring that the public has access to this land. As a result, they want to ensure that the building of the pipeline is done in a safe and environmentally sound way. To do this, they will typically require that the pipeline developer submit a detailed plan for how they will build the pipeline, with a focus on how they will mitigate any potential environmental impacts.\n\nThis plan must be approved by the relevant government entity before the pipeline can be built. This is where the voting comes in. The government entity will typically be made up of representatives from each of the different levels of government. For example, the state government may appoint representatives from the state legislature, the state's environmental agency, and the state's natural resources agency.

We can list some estimates and their errors:\n\nN - Number of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy - Probably less than 10, maybe as many as 100\nR* - average rate of star formation in our galaxy - 1-2 per year\nfp - fraction of stars that have planetary systems - 0.3\nne - number of planets per star that can support life - 2\nfl - fraction of planets that develop life - 0.3\nfi - fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that communicates across space - 0.1\nfc - fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that can detect radio signals across space - 0.1\nL - duration of civilization's ability to communicate across space - millions of years\nD - minimum detectable signal strength, e.g. from a distant radio transmitter - 10-16 watts\n\nWith these numbers and assumptions, we can calculate the number of detectable civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy, using the factor of 10^6 in the equation for D. The result is:\n\n~ 10 000\n\nWith a factor of 100 or even 1000 in D, the calculation becomes meaningless, since the number of detectable civilizations would be much greater than the number of galaxies in the observable universe."}

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

The Agenda has a flagship programme entitled the “Silencing the Guns: Creating Conducive Conditions for Africa’s Development” which aims to end all wars on the continent by 2020.\n\nThe Agenda also recognizes the importance of aviation to the continent’s economic and social development, noting in particular the potential of aviation to contribute to the economic integration of the continent. The Agenda calls for the acceleration of the development of air transport infrastructure, including airports and aerodromes, in line with the priorities of the African Commission on Aviation CARAC. The Agenda notes that the development of aviation will require the establishment of efficient air navigation services to support the safe, secure and orderly growth of air traffic and that this will facilitate intra-African air connectivity.\n\nThe African Union Commission has developed a 20-year vision for the development of the aviation industry in Africa, known as the Aviation Strategy for Africa (AVSEC). The AVSEC, which was adopted in 2016, includes a number of initiatives to support the development of aviation in Africa, including the “Single African Sky”, a program to harmonize and coordinate the management of air traffic in Africa. The AVSEC also includes a number of actions to improve aviation security and facilitate the implementation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Technical Assistance and Safety Oversight (TASO) Agreement.\n\nICAO also has a number of programs to support the development of aviation in Africa, including the Global Aviation Safety Oversight (GASO) program, which helps States and air operators to implement the ICAO Safety Standards and Recommended Practices (SSRPs). The ICAO CORSIA global offsetting mechanism (COO) for international aviation emissions launched in 2018, which aims to reduce the growth in international aviation emissions from 2020. CORSIA is a market-based measure that will apply to all international aviation emissions from 2020. ICAO also has a number of programs to support the development of aviation in Africa, including the Global Aviation Safety Oversight (GASO) program, which helps States and air operators to implement the ICAO Safety Standards and Recommended Practices (SSRPs)."}

In an attempt to protect the islands fishermen from the storms, a group of people gathered at the top of the island in order to pray to the sea god Neptune. The ritual was performed with the intention of securing calm seas for the year to come. While the ritual was successful and the seas remained calm, the islanders didn't perceive the calm seas as a sign of protection but rather as a sign that the sea god was displeased. The islanders were afraid that the god would destroy their boats and therefore their livelihoods and were too scared to remove their boats from the water. They felt that the god would take his anger out on the fishermen and their families for disrespecting him. In a desperate attempt to placate the sea god, the islanders started to sacrifice their dogs and cats to him. The islanders continued to sacrifice animals to the sea god until one night the sea god visited the island in a storm. He destroyed the boats, killed the fishermen and took their souls to the deep.

Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window because the center pane of a triple pane window is not as effective as the two outer panes. In the cold climate, the extra pane increases the insulating value of the window and makes it more efficient. In the warm climate, the extra pane increases the U-value. Increasing the number of panes increases the thermal insulating value, but at a certain point, the added benefit becomes marginal.

To a lesser extent, Cantonese is also similar to the Min dialects, which are spoken in the southern provinces of Fujian and Guangdong.\n\nThe Cantonese spoken in the former British colony and current Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong is officially known as Hong Kong Cantonese to distinguish it from the variant of Cantonese spoken in mainland China. The two variants are mutually intelligible, but have slight differences in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\nCantonese is traditionally written using traditional Chinese characters, although simplified characters are gaining official recognition. In the 1980s, a new Cantonese romanization system called Yale was developed and promoted in the United States, and has been adapted by a number of local governments.

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional type annotations to the JavaScript code, allowing the compiler to provide type checking and other static analysis features. TypeScript has a number of features that support the development of large and complex systems, such as modules, classes, interfaces, and object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs.\n\nDuck Typing is a form of dynamic programming that allows programmers to treat different data types as being interchangeable. This is done by checking for certain properties of the data, rather than its specific type. For example, a function taking a string parameter can be used with an integer without changing its behavior. This is in contrast to strong typing, where two variables are specifically declared to be a certain type, and the code assumes that they will always have that type."}

{"id": "koala_159", "prompt": "When I open Anki browser, It shuts down. how can i fix this?", "answer": "First of all, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Anki browser, and that you have installed it correctly. If they are both good, then this issue could be caused by one of the following reasons:\n\n1. You might have multiple Anki browsers installed, and you have opened the latest version of the browser by mistake. In this case, you can try to find and delete the old browser, and then open the latest version.\n2. If you have only one Anki browser installed, but you have opened it from the shortcut on your desktop, then you might want to check if the shortcut points to the right location. If not, you can try to change the shortcut location to the right path, and then try to open the browser.\n3. If you have followed the steps above, but the issue is still there, then there could be something wrong with the browser itself. In this case, I would recommend you to remove the browser and then reinstall it again, and see if it works."}
{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Scientific consensus indicates that climate change is a real and pressing issue that threatens the health and wellbeing of people, as well as the environment, in the coming years. Evidence indicates that the earth's average temperature has increased by about 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880 due to human activities, and if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trajectory, it is projected the earth will warm another 2 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the 21st century. While it is true that the earth's climate has always changed, the current pace of change is unprecedented and is happening much faster than the earth's natural ability to adapt. The consequences of climate change will be pervasive, and will impact people in every country and every region of the world, as well as plants, animals, and ecosystems.\n\nWhile climate change has many impacts that will be felt by future generations, the consequences of climate change in the coming years will be particularly severe. These include: more frequent and intense extreme weather events, sea level rise, melting glaciers and polar ice, ocean acidification, and the spread of infectious diseases. These consequences can have devastating impacts on people's homes, health, and livelihoods, and also implicate human rights. For example, extreme weather events can lead to food shortages, which can increase hunger and malnutrition rates. In addition, climate change can exacerbate existing social and political tensions, for example, by increasing the frequency of conflicts over resources and leading to mass migrations.\n\nThe good news is that we have the knowledge, technology, and resources necessary to take action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. A number of steps can be taken at the local, national, and international levels to help address climate change. At the local level, individuals can take steps such as conserving energy, driving less, and purchasing climate-friendly products. Individuals can also influence their governments to take action by contacting their representatives, signing petitions, and participating in peaceful protests. At the national level, governments can adopt policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a variety of sectors, such as transportation, energy production, and agriculture. They can also provide financial incentives for individuals and businesses to invest in energy efficient and low carbon technologies, and encourage the adoption of sustainable practices. At the international level, governments can convene to negotiate global agreements to limit greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. They can also provide financial and technical assistance to help developing countries adapt to the effects of climate change and reduce their emissions.\n\nWhile climate change is undoubtedly a daunting challenge, the good news is that there are many solutions available to address it, and by working together we can take meaningful action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and protect our planet for future generations."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "Films are typically longer than TV episodes, but the main difference is that TV episodes are typically broken up into acts. Acts are naturally breaks in the narrative where a new piece of information is introduced, or a new plot point is introduced, or where the characters make a decision.  Most films do not follow this act structure.  This makes it feel like less effort to watch three back to back TV episodes than a film.  The breaks in the narrative in the TV episodes help the viewer understand where we are in the story, and where it is going.  Without these breaks in a film, you have to remember everything that is happening and remember where the story is going.  This is the reason that film watching feels like more of an effort than TV watching."}
{"id": "koala_162", "prompt": "Findings from Jumping Monkey Hill (Story #1)\nPlease respond to the following questions/prompts below. Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.\n\nWhat were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "The three motifs that were found to be present in this story are those of the American Dream/Disillusionment, Journey/Coming of Age, and Immigrants/Migrants. The first of these, the American Dream/Disillusionment, is present on multiple levels. First, the story is told from the perspective of a young Nigerian girl who immigrated to the United States with her family. She had been told by everyone around her that living in America would mean unlimited opportunities for her, and that she would be able to fulfill her American Dream, whatever that might be. However, even after arriving in America, she finds that this is not the case and instead realizes that the reality of life in America is much different than what she had anticipated. Second, the story is set in a place called Jumping Monkey Hill, which is meant to be a quirky, touristy place that is meant to be a representation of all the things that are \"American.\" As the protagonist learns more about the true nature of American culture, however, she realizes that there is a lot more to it than what she had been led to believe. Finally, the story also touches on the theme of being a first-generation immigrant and the struggles and challenges that come with being in a new country. The protagonist encounters many people who are hostile towards her, either because they are American or because they are African-American, and she finds herself questioning what it really means to be an American and whether or not she truly belongs. Overall, these themes appear multiple times throughout the story and help to shape the narrative."}

This will lock your screen so it appears you're looking at it, but you could actually be doing something else. The downside is that you'd have to remember to lock the screen each time.\n\nAnother option is to use a service like Invisible mode, which will display a computer-generated image that looks like you're actively listening, but it's actually just a still image. The downside of this is that, unlike a screen locker, you won't be able to interact with anything on your screen.\n\nFinally, you could use a service like Snapchat that allows you to create a short video message that your callers can watch. This could be a good option if you know you'll only be unavailable for a few minutes."}

At low temperatures, the electrons are not moving much, and the wavelengths emitted are determined by the binding energy of the electrons. The higher the temperature, the more the electrons are moving, and the longer the wavelength that is emitted."}

{"id": "koala_166", "prompt": "Explain sarcoidosis to me like I’m a five year old", "answer": "Sarcoidosis is a disease of the lymphatic system, which is the body's defense system against infection. It causes tiny lumps of inflamed tissue, called granulomas, to form in different parts of the body.\n\nWhen someone has sarcoidosis, their immune system is overactive. It mistakenly thinks a threat is present, so it starts to produce proteins called antibodies. These antibodies travel through the blood to areas of the body where they shouldn't be, leading to the formation of granulomas.\n\nThe granulomas that form in sarcoidosis often affect the lymph nodes, the lungs, and the eyes. They can also occur in the liver, spleen, skin, and brain.\n\nTreatment for sarcoidosis depends on how severe the symptoms are and where they are affecting the body. For example, people with eye problems may be prescribed eye drops to reduce inflammation.\n\nSarcoidosis is a chronic condition, which means that people with it may have periods of remission, when symptoms get better and go away on their own. However, the disease often comes back at some point.\n\nThere is no cure for sarcoidosis. But most people with the condition lead full, active lives."}

There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " ((p (n of al of this (cer (ar of (d ((our (F [g ((that [-([m (c of (-(f-de, and of (of of of of the of of of of of [of of of of of, of of of of of of (of of our of dali [ch (s (c of ((when (c (p (m (c or are - and (c (t of (of c of -c of-h of - [n –S (d,(N n (h of it al of m (of of of of of (t (c ((and in (m, (h (a of (c of of ‘s of (dis of of of (C of (c of ‘S,-S (c (S (c (c of of of of it of of of, of of of of (c of (N (I (th and [th of (of of (per of of [N of gry of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ((t (of of (e of of of of of of of of of of of of of (n (h of of (c of or in of and: (to of ((C of of of of of of of of of of (c of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ([  [ of of of of of but of back of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of or of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of ( of of of of of ( ( of of ( of of of of of of of of b of ( of of of of of of of of (of of of of of of of of of of of, of of of of of of of of  of or of a of of of of ( of of ( of of of of both, of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of d of of of of ( of of ( [st ( ( -c and ( ( [–w (ne (n [n our n, (, [  of of of of [f of (l of of of of of of ( and ( and, on, of t of of of of the of of of the of of of-de of, of the ( (ve  of [h ( of ( of of of the of- of of of of of of((( ( ( ( ( ( ( ((t ( H C ([ and ( ( (f-b B of a ( when (h- ( when ( ( (- but but B ( (, ( (, ( of our, ( – ch, [d ( and ( if (-c and, ( (c ( (m of the people (b (am of (t (( ( ( ( ( “ H ‘( ( at ( (( ( ( ( (h ( ( and ( ( [de ( ( ( ( and ‘ of some of of [ of ( ( and ( if d and [ of our of of ( ( of- and and “ and – and of and of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of - d (de and ( (c ( and of. of of, of of of of of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of- (( (h [e w( b ( ( (b sh-la b ( of (e of (as in-de (( of our ( ( ( ( and of un of ( of of- of of of of of of of of of of of of of of (, ( and (( and for in [t-sh of – of of and ( of of of of of of (c ( of and of ( of or of of t of of of of of go of of of of of of of of of ( [ or if ( in d ( our of c of of of of of of of N of ( of of of of of of of, of and of of of of of of of of of of of of of, of of of of of of s of of of of, of and for of for of and of in in, ( of as ( as, ( of do and of of t of C of- “ and of, of of of of of and of  of of of de of of w of ( and and of of of of w of of of of of of or of of of and of of ( d of C( ( d [ and ( of ( of de de,"}
