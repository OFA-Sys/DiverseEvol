{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banks do not use cash as capital. Capital is a very broad concept, and in the context of financial institutions, capital refers to the total amount of money that the firm has available to absorb losses, provide loans, and generally remain solvent. Capital is typically split into two categories, common equity and preferred equity. Common equity is the shareholders' equity in the firm. It is the first class of loss absorption. The second class of loss absorption is preferred equity, which is more debt-like, and usually pays a higher return, but is subordinate to common equity in the event of a liquidation.\n\nCash is one of the ways that banks can generate more capital, but there are two main reasons why this is not a viable option. First, banks already have a lot of cash on hand in their accounts. They do not need more cash to provide new loans. Second, the cash itself is not a form of capital. It is a liability of the bank, and it needs to be backed by assets, which are the loans that the bank makes. If a bank has a lot of cash and no loans, then that cash would not be considered capital."}

", "answer": "Hildibrand Manderville was a young man of the highest order. He was a Lord of the Eight Houses, a peer of the realm, and a member of the ancient and noble House of Manderville. The Mandervilles had a long and storied history of service to the realm, including the knights of old who had fought beside King Arthur, and the Manderville family was known for its charity and benevolence. Hildibrand was a scholar of note, and had written many works of philosophy and theology, as well as a large number of poems. He was the second son of the Lord of the Eight Houses and Lady Evelyn, and he was known for his kindness and his fairness.\n\nOne night, as he was studying late at night, he heard a voice calling out to him from the street outside. \"Hildibrand Manderville! Hildibrand Manderville! I have need of your aid!\" Hildibrand looked out the window and saw a strange old man in a cloak and a pointed hat. \"I need you to help me summon a demon!\" said the old man. \"I just need one to do my bidding for me, I promise it will be quick and easy! I can assure you that you will not be harmed!\" Hildibrand was curious, but also wary. The old man seemed a bit strange, and Hildibrand was reluctant to do as he asked. But the old man was insistent, and Hildibrand could not refuse. \"Alright, then, I shall help you. But I do want one condition. I want you to swear to me that you will not harm me in any way. I have seen too many horrors in my day to wish for something like that.\"\n\nThe old man agreed, and Hildibrand opened the door and let the man in. They went down to the basement, and Hildibrand lit a fire in the fireplace to light their way down. They found a pentagram drawn on the floor, and the old man said, \"Here, this is where we will conjure the demon. But first, let us light the candles and say the appropriate chant.\" He did so, and then he began to chant, and Hildibrand joined him. The old man was chanting in Latin, but Hildibrand knew it well, as he was well versed in both theology and the occult. He could not help but think that the old man was a bit off, though, as he had a strange accent for a Latin speaker. He kept chanting, and soon he saw a strange light in the center of the pentagram. He kept chanting, and soon the light was getting stronger and brighter, and Hildibrand could see the shape of a woman in the middle of the pentagram, although she was made of shadow.\n\nThe old man finished his chant, and Hildibrand joined in. \"Go to your master, and do his will! Go to your master, and do his will!\" The shadow woman began to shake and quake, and then she began to scream. \"I am the spirit of the pentagram! I am the spirit of the pentagram!\" she cried. \"I am the spirit of the pentagram! I am the spirit of the pentagram!\" Hildibrand and the old man were stunned. \"What is this?\" cried Hildibrand. \"We did not summon a demon! We summoned a pentagram spirit!\" \"Nonsense!\" replied the old man. \"This is a demon, and we have bound it to our will. Call it whatever you will!\" \"But the pentagram spirit is a well-known phenomenon!\" said Hildibrand. \"And it is very rare to summon one. This is not a demon, but a pentagram spirit!\" \"Nonsense!\" cried the old man. \"This is a demon, and we have bound it to our will.\" Hildibrand and the old man began to argue, but then the pentagram spirit began to scream even louder, and Hildibrand was stunned. \"What is going on here?\" Hildibrand cried. \"I summoned a demon, and you tell me I summoned a pentagram spirit? What did you do?\" \"We did not summon a demon,\" the old man replied. \"And I did not summon a pentagram spirit. This is a demon, and we have bound it to our will.

I moved to the United States when I was in high school. I've always been interested in the arts and started taking dance lessons when I was 10. I was also very passionate about film and started making my own short films when I was 13. Ever since I was a child, I always dreamed of becoming a film director.\nWhen I was in high school, I was accepted at a performing arts high school for fine arts. I studied filmmaking in high school and went on to major in film at the University of Southern California. After that, I moved to New York and worked in the film industry as a production assistant.\nI have been working as a film director and screenwriter for the past 5 years.\nI'm currently living in Los Angeles, but I'm also in New York a lot. As a film director, I travel a lot.\n\nYou are a female director and it's very rare to see female directors in the film industry. Why do you think that is?\nIt is definitely true that women are underrepresented in the film industry. A lot of people in the film industry have to do with networking. It helps to have a lot of friends in the industry to help you get jobs. It also helps to know a lot of people in the industry to promote your work. It's very hard to break into the industry as a film director if you don't have people in the industry who know you. That's why a lot of women don't have opportunities to direct films. A lot of women have to wait until they have to connections in the film industry to get their films made. A lot of women will wait until they get a job as a director's assistant or a production assistant to start networking and making connections with people in the industry. Some women will go to film school to learn how to make films, but some women don't want to go to film school. For example, I didn't want to go to film school. I wanted to start making my own films and directing my own films right away. I didn't want to wait a long time to learn how to make my own films. A lot of women who don't want to go to film school will learn how to make films by watching YouTube videos. A lot of women will start making their own films and learn how to direct their own films without film school. A lot of women will try to direct their own films, but they might not get the opportunity to direct their own films because they don't have connections in the industry. It's easier for women to direct their own films if they have connections in the industry. I find that it's really hard for women to direct their own films if they don't have connections in the industry. I'm really lucky because I have a lot of connections in the industry and I've been able to direct my own films. I'm grateful that I've been able to direct my own films and be a female film director.\n\nI'm also a screenwriter. A lot of screenwriters are women. It's much easier to be a screenwriter than it is to be a film director because you don't have to make your own films. A lot of women write screenplays for other people to direct. There are a lot of women screenwriters. A lot of women screenwriters write screenplays for female characters. It's really interesting to see how women are portrayed in films. There are a lot of films about women, but a lot of times women are portrayed as weak, helpless or submissive characters. I've written a lot of screenplays about strong female characters. It's important for women to see themselves represented in films.\n\nI've also written a lot of short films. A lot of film festivals only accept short films. Short films are very popular, but a lot of people don't know about them. Short films are very popular on YouTube. Some of the most popular short films on YouTube are animated short films. A lot of people don't know that there are a lot of animated short films out there, but they are really popular on YouTube. It's really cool to see how short films are changing and how they are evolving. The way people watch films is changing. Most people watch films on their phones or computers. A lot of film festivals are accepting short films made on mobile devices. It's really cool to see how film festivals are changing.

{"id": "koala_15", "prompt": "Why is it that only proteins, carbohydrates and fats are deemed to have caloric value?<br>Just to clarify - consider the hypothetical situation below:<br>100g of 'carbohydrates' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'protein' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'fat' = 900kCal<br>100g of 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes' = ?", "answer": "To answer your question - there is no specific 'caloric value' for 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes'. This is because it is extremely difficult to identify the exact calories consumed from these ingredients. The reason for this is that, in a normal diet, the amount of 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes' consumed is insignificant compared to the number of calories consumed from the other three macronutrients, namely proteins, carbohydrates and fats. \n\nFor example, the human body needs 100g of carbohydrates in a day to function properly. So, if the human body only needs 100g of carbohydrates in a day, then the human body will only convert 100g of carbohydrates to energy. If the human body needs 100g of proteins in a day, then the human body will only convert 100g of proteins to energy. If the human body needs 100g of fats in a day, then the human body will only convert 100g of fats to energy. There is no need for the human body to convert 100g of 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes', as they are insignificant compared to the macronutrients. \n\nTherefore, it is very difficult to measure how many calories from 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes' are consumed from a given food. For example, if the human body consumes 100g of carrots, how many calories of 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes' from the carrots are consumed? This is very difficult to determine."}

Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " in,. and.... and ch,.-b in to to.a-ch, and (h and,,.-and-my-c-t-h and...... in (j-s and in to. to in-to to to to and and (d-of of of of of c of of of..

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " \nTheulices and \nThe 113 11-number 3-toppings. 1 version 2 months andifying 151 and Â 1864014332442234 24.

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

Be creative.", "answer": "The backstory of my half-elf ranger character for Pathfinder begins in the year 2004 in the town of Arhynn, a small and picturesque village in the Feywild. In this town lived a beautiful half-elf named Rylie. Rylie was born in this village and her family had lived there for generations. She was a talented young archer and had competed in several local competitions against other archers. One day, Rylie was training with other archers when a massive battle took place in the distance. She could see the smoke rising in the distance and the sound of war horns was loud and clear. She had heard of warriors from the nearby human towns raiding the villages of the Feywild. Rylie was curious and decided to go out and see what was happening. She took her bow and quietly made her way towards the smoke. She followed the sounds of battle until she came to a clearing. There she saw a small group of human warriors surrounding a large group of orcs. The humans were killing the orcs with swords, axes and bows. Rylie could see some of the humans were badly wounded and bleeding, but they still fought on. A human woman was amongst the orcs and she also fought on. Rylie could see the woman was badly injured. The woman was a warrior, and she had a large sword and a shield. She had one eye that was blackened by a large bruise. She was fighting a large orc warrior with a long spear and she was fending him off. Rylie could only see the woman's back, but she could tell this was an epic battle, just like the one in the movies she had seen. She had never seen someone fight so well. The woman was using her shield to block the spear and then she would strike back with her sword. The orc warrior was getting frustrated with the woman and he started to get angry. He swung his spear again and the woman blocked the blow with her shield. She quickly moved to the side and thrust her sword through the orc's chest. The woman turned around and faced the other orcs. She was surrounded by them now and they were all charging forward. Rylie could see the woman was badly wounded but she was still fighting. Rylie could hear the warriors behind her calling to her to get out of there. She had never seen anyone fight like that. The woman turned around and saw Rylie watching her. She smiled at Rylie and called out to her. \"Come on little one, you should get out of here.\" Rylie was shocked and confused. She had never seen a person that could fight so well. Rylie turned and ran back to the town. The woman turned back to the orcs and continued fighting. Rylie was amazed at what she had just seen. How could a human be so strong and skilled? She had to know more about this woman.\n\nA few days later, Rylie was walking along the road that led to the town of Arhynn. She had her bow in her hand and she was practicing her archery. As she walked, she saw a woman in the distance. She was wearing heavy armor and she was carrying a large sword. She was walking towards the town. Rylie could see the woman was injured. She limped and her left arm was in a sling. She had a large bruise on her forehead and her left eye was blackened. Rylie immediately recognized her as the warrior she had seen fight the orcs. She could see the woman was in desperate need of medical help. She quickly ran to her side. \"Are you okay?\" she asked. The woman looked at her in shock. \"You're a half-elf!\" she said. Rylie nodded. \"I'm Rylie\", she said. The woman helped Rylie up. \"I'm Vera. What are you doing out here?\" \"I was out practicing my archery.\" \"You are a good archer. I could see you from the road. I'm wounded and I need help. I was coming to the town to get help but I can't make it on my own. Can you help me?\" Rylie nodded. \"Of course. Come on, follow me.\" Rylie helped Vera to her feet and they walked together towards the town. As they walked, Vera told Rylie her story. \"I was on my way to the town of Caldwen.

{"id": "koala_58", "prompt": "which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions", "answer": "calcium ions are released from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to the binding of a thyroid hormone to the thyroid hormone receptor. This binding stimulates the activation of the G protein Gs, resulting in the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) on the alpha subunit of the G protein. The G protein then activates an enzyme called adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. The increase in cAMP subsequently activates protein kinase A, which then phosphorylates the cytosolic free calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) to form CaMK/A. The phosphorylated CaMK/A then binds to and activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK), leading to the phosphorylation of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), which pumps Ca2+ out of the endoplasmic reticulum. This release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum activates a number of downstream signal transduction pathways, including the protein kinase C pathway, the phospholipase C pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and the protein kinase A pathway, which trigger a variety of cellular responses."}

You are now an owner of the business, which means you have a stake in the company's success. You're essentially making an investment in the business.\n\nWhen the company does well - that is, when it makes a profit - part of that profit is distributed to the owners (shareholders) as a \"dividend.\"\n\nWhen you buy stock in a company, you are actually buying shares. Each share represents a portion of the company's stock. If you buy shares in a company that has 100,000 shares, you've purchased 1/100,000 of the company. If the company has 1 million shares, each share is worth 1/1,000,000 of the company.\n\nThe value of a share is determined by the market. If the demand for a specific share is high, the price will go up. If the demand is low, the price will go down.\n\nWhen you buy shares of a company, you don't actually get a share of the company. Rather, you get a \"stock certificate\" from the company that represents your portion of ownership. The certificate represents your right to a portion of the company's earnings - for example, if the company makes a profit, you get a portion of that profit.\n\nIn the United States, stocks are traded on a stock market called the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

{"id": "koala_80", "prompt": "Why does warmth make you feel tired?", "answer": "When you are exposed to a warm environment, you feel tired because your body needs to work hard to cool you down. This is called thermogenesis. Your body cools you down by sweating, which is a process called evaporation. As your sweat evaporates from your skin, it takes heat with it. Your body has to work hard to replace the heat it loses.\n\nAll animals have some means of controlling their body temperature, but humans have the most sophisticated and complex ways of keeping their body temperature within a narrow range. When the ambient temperature increases, the body's natural cooling mechanisms work harder. When the ambient temperature increases too much, your body cannot keep up and you begin to overheat. When your body temperature gets too high, you start to feel tired and want to take a nap. This is the same reason you feel tired when you exercise in warm weather, even though you are getting the benefits of exercise."}

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The finite element method (FEM) is a form of computational solid mechanics. It is used to analyze static and dynamic structural problems. It is the most widely used technique today for predicting the behavior of real structures, as well as for conducting design and optimization.\n\nWithin FEM, a model of a physical system is created using elements that represent single units of the system, called finite elements. Solving problems using FEM requires the specification of elements properties based on relevant physical parameters, and the specification of element geometries. For static problems, element positions are determined by applying a loading, and solving for equilibrium. The resulting internal forces and stresses are then used to determine the response of the model. For dynamic problems, the model is integrated using specific time incrementation to account for small time steps. The response is then determined using integration of the resulting equation of motion.\n\nFEM is a flexible tool capable of analyzing a wide range of problems. It can be used to solve problems in static, dynamics, vibrations, stress and strain, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics, among other applications."}

{"id": "koala_84", "prompt": "Title: \"Inspiration, Infallibility, and Inerrancy: Hath God Said? with R.C. Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": "in,in of [c,int (th of (pro,in,cor,and,co (pop of ((of,of of [of of (of of (of of our of your [of of int of of of of of (in of the of (of of, of a of of, of, of of [and of the (gener [inc of (sen of a (due (in.c -and,d [c [in [se?C.inter,sp of the of,conology,, (p, of,[cou, or or,ch,h,per,c,s,in,in,p of,in of,cl,in of, of, and,supp of,gener of,f of the of,hove of,in,of,p and of,in of,f,dis,pop,s,in,in,s,in,and,pop,in,ina,c, and, and of, of of of of of the of, of of of, of (of of of of, of of of of, of,of of of [c of (in of [center of of, of, [t, of, of (b of,of of [subject, of,c,int (s of,d,in,m-p,cor,ink of (civine of (c-dis of (h of,subject of,c of you,w of [(of(w and of (du (w of the (co of, [dis, [int, [C, (d, (h,c,or (in,of, (th, of, of, (per, (th of (c,(subject, of, (h,,se,, of (and, (d, (f.(f:c, the, ([[you of, and,of, (and,int,in,co, [c, or,,d (c of,.they of of (you, (c-you of, [in, and, you, or (–c, (st of (b,of of,c of, and,-(b, (co,,, (f ((s,-co, of (in,,—in.,(in, of, of of of of of, of of, (b of of, of,,, (w, (in,, (C, [by, and (my (of, of, of the and, of, of, ro, the, of the (h of, of (for, in, and, (l, (and, on, and, and, (b, (b,(and and,ink and,f (th,, and,w (J,b, of the of our of the of of of, of-of,of,. of (C,.,, of n, of of -of of, of,, or,, of, of, or, of,,? of t,of, of, of, of (of-of of of of, of,, of, of,of of, of, of, of (of, of, of, of of (of of, and, of,, (th (co-and,, of, of, trans of,,, (t, (w, and, (c, or, of, of the, of of of, of, of of of of, of the,-th, in,--P, (H,, and, (-of,, of [of,,, of, (of, in of ((h and, and, of,, (and of,,, of, of, of (of, of, of, of, of, of (in, of, of, of,,, or,, (un, and st, over, (B, (f of, of of of of of of (b of (of of of, of (B of of of of of of their of of of of, (of of of of the ( (n,,,, our (l of of, of of, of, of, of of of, of (of of of (of (of, of (of of, of of of of of of of, of, of,, of, of, of of of of (t, [c of, of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of, and of ((s of, of un of, of, of of of of of of of, of of of of, of, of, of, of (of, of (S of, of of (of, (c, of of the of of ( of of of of, of, em,"}

First, the wort is boiled for 60 minutes, at which point the hops are added to the brew.  Hops add bitterness to the beer and can also create flavors and aromas.  After this, the brew is cooled down to a temperature that allows yeast to be added to the wort.  Lastly, the brew is allowed to ferment for 7 to 14 days.  The amount of hops added to the brew determines the hoppy character of the beer. "}

{"id": "koala_89", "prompt": "what are five important topics for game design", "answer": "1. The importance of playtesting. Playtesting is critical to the success of any game. Without playtesting, you run the risk of creating a game that doesn't work. Playtesting allows you to see your game from a new perspective, and gives you a chance to see if your rules, components, and aesthetics are working properly. It also provides players with an opportunity to comment on the game, and to provide their feedback. During playtesting, you should observe the game being played, and take notes on what needs to be changed, or added.\n2. The importance of choosing the right theme for your game. The theme of the game is what ties the mechanics together, and provides the game with a sense of identity. You should choose a theme that will engage players, and interest them in learning more about the game. The theme can also help to make the game more unique. For example, if you are creating a game about space exploration, you can make your game stand out by including gameplay mechanics that are unique to space exploration.\n3. The importance of creating a strong aesthetic for your game. The aesthetic of the game is what ties the components and artwork together. It is also what makes the game appealing to players. The aesthetic of your game should be unique, and it should reflect the theme of the game. For example, if you are making a game about a space ship, your aesthetic should reflect the theme of space travel. It should include artwork of space, and it should utilize components that have a space theme.\n4. The importance of choosing the right components for your game. The components of the game are what players will interact with during play. For example, if you are making a game about building a train route, the train track and train cars are the components of the game, and players will use them to build a train route. The components are important because they need to accurately reflect the theme of the game. You also need to ensure that the components are sturdy and durable, so that they can withstand repeated use.\n5. The importance of choosing the right rules for your game. The rules of the game are what govern the way that the game is played. For example, when playing a game of chess, the rules of chess dictate how the pieces move, what the winning conditions are, and how players win the game. The rules of your game should be clear and easy to understand. They also need to accurately reflect the theme of the game. If the rules of your game are not clear, or if they are difficult to understand, players will not enjoy playing your game."}

It is an umbrella term for the application of digital and IT solutions in healthcare. Digital health aims to improve the quality, safety, and accessibility of health services. It also aims to reduce unnecessary healthcare costs. It encompasses all digital technologies that can be used to improve healthcare, including telehealth (remote healthcare), electronic health records (EHRs), mHealth (mobile health), medical apps, wearable devices, personalized medicine, health information exchange (HIE), health data, big data, and medical imaging.\n\nDigital health solutions are often as simple as a mobile app that allows patients to efficiently schedule doctor appointments. Other solutions, such as electronic health records (EHRs), use technology to organize, store, and share patients' health information and data. By allowing doctors to quickly access patients' information, digital health solutions can improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare.\n\nDigital health can also be used to empower people to take an active role in their own health. Wearable devices can track a patient's health metrics, such as their vital signs and movements. Patients can use this information to improve their health habits and avoid illness. Other digital health solutions can help patients overcome barriers that prevent them from accessing healthcare, such as transportation issues or lack of health insurance.\n\nDigital health benefits both patients and healthcare providers. Patients can use digital health solutions to schedule appointments, access their health information, and take an active role in their own health. Doctors and other healthcare providers can use digital health solutions to access patient information, make informed decisions, and reduce the need for in-person visits. Digital health also enables providers to monitor patients who are homebound or in remote locations."}

However, it is suggested that you first build a presale contract to gather a group of early investors. This is particularly useful for projects with a large token supply. In this case, the presale contract will allow you to \"crowd sell\" your tokens to a large group of investors.\n\nYou can then use the tokens from your presale contract to fund your main smart contract.

The employee's primary duty must be the management of the organization or a department within the organization. The employee must direct the work of at least two full-time employees, or one full-time employee plus a part-time employee. A part-time employee is considered to be working as an employee if the employee works an average of at least 20 hours per week or 80 hours per month. The employee must direct the work of at least one full-time employee, or two part-time employees, to qualify as a manager.\n\nTo be considered an executive, the employee must have executive authority in the organization.

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

We use this knowledge to provide our customers with customized actions to take to help improving their customer retention.\n\nOcean, on the other hand, is already using AI to help their customers with their marketing decisions and campaigns. They are using AI to predict the impact of campaigns, which is very important for a marketing manager to make the right decision on how to spend their marketing budget. We can join forces to integrate our two products and help our customers to gain even more value by getting insights into both their customer retention, as well as their marketing performance.\n\nFor our customers, it is very important to get insights into their customer retention, as well as their marketing campaigns.

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

{"id": "koala_148", "prompt": "#2. To increase the energy efficiency of windows, additional glass pane is added. In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "The energy efficiency of windows depends on their U-value.  The U-value of windows is the inverse of the total heat transfer through the window, which is the sum of the heat transfer through the center of glass and the heat transfer through the frame.  Heat transfer through the center of glass is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the center of glass and the temperature of the surrounding air.  Heat transfer through the frame is proportional to the difference between the outside temperature and the temperature of the center of glass.  The fraction of heat transfer through the window that occurs through the center of glass is called the center-of-glass transmittance.  The U-value of a window is determined by the U-value of the center of glass, the window's frame, and any other material in the window assembly, such as spacers and gas fills.\n\nThe U-value of a window depends on several factors, including the type of glazing, the type of frame, and the number of panes of glass.  In general, the higher the U-value, the lower the window's energy efficiency.  Double-pane windows are more energy efficient than single-pane windows, and triple-pane windows are more energy efficient than double-pane windows.  The energy efficiency of windows also depends on the type of gas fill, and varies based on the climate.  For cool climates, argon gas is typically used to fill the space between panes of glass.  For moderate climates, such as those of the south and west parts of the United States, krypton gas is typically used.  For warm climates such as those of the south and west parts of the United States, an airspace is used.  Windows with a U-value between 0.35 and 0.50 are usually considered energy efficient, while windows with a U-value between 0.20 and 0.35 are considered very energy efficient.  Windows with a U-value below 0.20 are considered highly energy efficient."}

As Saint Augustine said, “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better. As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals.\n\nFor example, both African American and African cultures share similarities.  Both groups are descendants of the same ancestors – the indigenous people of Africa. Both groups were forcefully taken as slaves from Africa to the Americas. Both groups were forced to work in harsh conditions on plantations and farms. Both groups faced discrimination in the United States for being Black. Both groups experienced the \"Great Migration\" from the rural South, which spurred a large movement of African Americans from the rural south to the urban North during the early to mid-twentieth century. Both groups experienced the \"Second Great Migration\" which was a second wave of Black migration from the South to the North during the mid-20th Century. Both groups have their own unique language, music, and other traditions. Both groups have a strong history of activism for Black liberation and civil rights.  Both groups are known for their exceptional athleticism, including many Olympic gold medalists. Both groups have a strong culture of fashion and style.\n\nHowever, both groups have some notable differences.  Both groups have different experiences of slavery, colonization, and oppression.  While African Americans were enslaved in the Americas, Africans were enslaved in their own countries and forced to work on plantations.  African Americans were brought to the Americas as slaves, but Africans were captured and sold into slavery by other Africans.  The African slave trade was also much larger than the Atlantic slave trade.  While African Americans were taken from their homes and families, Africans were often taken from other African communities and families.  Both groups were forced to work in harsh conditions on plantations for very little money.  African Americans were often forced to work in the fields, while Africans were often forced to work in the homes.  African Americans were denied basic rights and freedoms.  They were often denied the right to marry, own property, and travel.  African Americans were not allowed to learn how to read or write.

African Americans were often denied access to public transportation and were forced to take separate buses and trains.  African Americans were often denied access to libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions.  African Americans faced discrimination in the United States for being Black.  African Americans were often denied access to good schools.  African Americans were often prohibited from attending school.  African Americans were often segregated in schools and were not allowed to learn in the same schools as white children.  African Americans were often denied access to certain jobs.  African Americans were often segregated in housing markets and were not allowed to buy houses.  African Americans were often denied the right to vote.

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "Duck Typing is a design pattern where the type of an object is not checked at runtime, but rather it is checked at compile time. This means that the compiler will check the type of the object before the object is allowed to be used. If the object does not match the type that is specified, the compiler will throw an error before the program is allowed to run. \n\nThe purpose of Duck Typing is to allow \"loose typing\", where the type of an object is not specified until run time. This allows the developer to create a program that will accept objects of any type, and will work with it. This is typically used when developing a library or framework that other developers can use with their own objects. \n\nThere are several benefits to using Duck Typing. It allows for a flexible design that will accept an object without specifying the type ahead of time. The programmer does not need to care about the type of the object until runtime. This allows for a more dynamic programming style. The programmer can implement an algorithm without knowing the specific type of the objects that will be used in it. \n\nAnother benefit is that dynamic typing allows for \"late binding\". A program that uses duck typing will be able to use an object without knowing what type it is until runtime. This allows for more flexible and dynamic programming, where the programmer does not need to worry about the type of the object until runtime. \n\nDuck Typing does have some disadvantages. It requires more code, and a compiler must be used to check the type of the object. This can make code more complex and slow down the execution of the program. Additionally, a developer must be careful when using Duck Typing, as it can lead to code that is difficult to read and maintain."}

The fibers are very thin, measuring 0.005 inches (0.13 mm) in diameter, and are composed mostly of carbon. Carbon fibers are 15 times stronger than steel, but only weigh around one-third as much. Carbon fibers can be used in a wide range of applications, including creating ultra-strong materials for use in spacecraft and airplanes, to creating a lightweight material for use in tennis rackets.\n\nCarbon fibers are often woven together to create a fabric that can be used to create durable, lightweight structures. One of the earliest uses for carbon fiber in building construction was as a material for the external cladding of the EMPAC building at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The EMPAC building uses 500 m² of carbon fiber material.\n\nAs a result of its high strength-to-weight ratio, carbon fiber has been used in construction since the 1960s. In the early days of its use in building construction, carbon fiber was often used to replace steel components, such as I-beams, in reinforced concrete. In the 1990s, the use of carbon fiber in building construction expanded to include the creation of structural components, such as roof trusses, floor joists, structural walls, and staircases.\n\nCarbon fiber is used to create a variety of structural components for buildings, including roof trusses, floor joists, structural walls, and staircases. In a typical carbon fiber structure, the carbon fibers are typically oriented at a 0/90-degree angle to provide the most strength. The strength of the carbon fiber material is highly dependent on the weave pattern of the material.

{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "Farmers are losing a lot of their income. 24% of farmers are losing money and 32% are not even covering their costs. This is because of the price of inputs (seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) is increasing and at the same time prices for commodities are decreasing. Globally, farmers are being squeezed by the price of seeds and pesticides. \n\nOne of the reasons for this is the patenting of seeds. \nThe main reason for the increase in the cost of seeds is that there are patents on seeds. For example, Monsanto has patented a gene that enables the plants to resist the herbicide \"Roundup\". \nFarmers have had to buy seeds from Monsanto every year and it has been very expensive. \nThe farmers are not allowed to save the seeds for the next year.\nAnother reason for the increase in the price of inputs is the expansion of global competition. \nFarmers in Africa are not able to compete on quality or price with farmers from other countries. \n\nAfrica's agriculture is also facing the problems of climate change. \nAn increase in temperatures will increase the cost of production for farmers. \nThe crops will require more water due to the increase in temperatures. \nIncreasing temperatures will also lead to increased pest and disease outbreaks. \nThe use of pesticides is very expensive. \nThe use of pesticides also has environmental impacts."}

Global climate change has already caused a lot of damage around the world.  The damage will only continue to get worse.  Scientists say that there is a 95% chance that the earth's temperature has risen over the last 100 years due to human activities.  The major cause of this change is the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  These gases trap heat in the earth's atmosphere.  This extra heat raises the temperature of the earth and causes climate change.  There are many different effects of climate change.  Some of these include rising sea levels, more frequent and more severe storms, and a rise in the number and severity of wildfires.  The effects of climate change are already being felt, and the effects are going to get worse.  There are several things that we can do to reduce our impact on the environment and slow down climate change.  Many of these things are simple things that anyone can do.  For example, we can drive less, use less water, and recycle more.  Some of these things, like using more renewable energy and transitioning to a more plant-based diet, are going to take more effort.

One of the most recent and famous cases you could defend is the annexation of Crimea, which took place in 2014. The events that led to the invasion of Crimea began on the 23 of February 2014, when the parliament of Ukraine adopted Resolution No. 6126, which set the procedure for holding a referendum on the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea on May 25, 2014. The resolution was signed by the President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nOn 21 February 2014, the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea adopted a declaration of independence from Ukraine. The declaration stated that Crimea was part of Russia and requested the Russian Federation to \"ensure the constitutional right of Crimean citizens to self-determination\".\n\nOn 27 February 2014, the President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed a decree \"On the temporary use of the territory of the Russian Federation for holding events of the Olympic and Paralympic Games of 2014 and of the 2014 FIFA World Cup\" due to the threat of terrorism. The decree granted permission to the Russian Ministry of Defence to use the territory of Ukraine to transport equipment and supplies.\n\nOn 1 March 2014, a group of armed men, believed to be members of the Russian military, took control of the airports in Simferopol and Sevastopol. The men were reportedly dressed in unmarked uniforms without insignia. The military staged a \"snap inspection\" at the Ukrainian base in Crimea. The inspection was the pretext for the takeover. They stated they were protecting the base from Ukrainian forces. The Russian Defence Ministry said it had deployed additional troops to Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. On 3 March 2014, the Russian Defence Ministry said that 200 paratroopers tasked with defending the Belbek airbase in Crimea had been deployed.\n\nOn 1 March 2014, the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea announced the integration of the region into Russia. Crimean prime minister Sergey Aksyonov stated that the Crimean parliament had no intention of complying with the Ukrainian government and that it intended to join the Russian Federation. The Rada requested that Ukraine's constitutional court rule on whether the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between Russia and Ukraine was still valid. The Ukrainian constitutional court ruled on 3 March 2014 that the treaty was still valid and that it could not be terminated unilaterally.\n\nFollowing the takeover of the airports in Crimea, the Crimean parliament then voted to hold a referendum on 16 March 2014, to decide on the region's status. The referendum was held on 16 March 2014, and was deemed illegal and illegitimate by the Ukrainian government and the most of the international community. It was also criticized for being held on the same day as the Ukrainian elections. According to the official results, 96.77% of the voters supported joining Russia. However, these results were denounced as fraudulent by the Ukrainian government, the US and the EU, who stated that the referendum and its outcome were not recognised by any country. In response, Russia recognised the referendum results and subsequently annexed Crimea.\n\nThe events that took place in Crimea were followed by a series of other events in Ukraine. By 6 April 2014, pro-Russian insurgents had taken control of government buildings in at least 10 cities in eastern Ukraine. At least 42 people were killed in the unrest. On 11 April 2014, the parliament of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk held a referendum on independence, which resulted in 89% of voters supporting independence. On 17 April 2014, the parliament of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Luhansk held a similar referendum, with 96% of voters supporting independence.\n\nAt the same time, the Ukrainian government was conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the pro-Russian insurgents in the east. The Ukrainian army regained control of most of the cities taken over by the insurgents by the end of 2014.\n\nOn 21 July 2014, the Ukrain"}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": "dis of of of our of (n of of ([of of a of a of (dis (back [C ((f ((do c of (F - (h (h or, or of our of – -of (of of of of of b of of of of (c, of of of of of of,of of (n of of and of a of of of of of (when of of (c,c (c-per people and or of (c b of (c –h of an-h of a-n as and or –-f of a sh (h (of of-th of c of of of m of of the of the (h (((per?b (of of -of of the of of of of (of for of (f of of of (of of (to ((c of-t of of of (B of of of (h of our of ((to of, or of of (s of ((th of (of of of ‘of of of ((c of and (or of (ne of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of and of, of –(a of and of of of [c-h of (h of of of of [p of, (se of, and ((c of of of of of of of of of of of of of of as of of of of of of of of of (c of of of of of of of of of of of of (lo of (h of-of of the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the of of of of of of of of or of (of of of of of of of of of (f of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of per of of of of of ( of ( of of of of of, of of of of of, of, of of of (of of of of of of of of of [of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of c of or of of of of of of of [al in,-H, or [and, of C: (c [ne (of [b (am, it [do of of of-as of of of of of c of or and ([(t-st (t, and of, of and of of the of of of of (F-Nam of of our when of ‘c on and-N of of - of of the of in of of of of, (am of t ( ( ( ( [de, ( ( ( ( (p (de-S-of and of (as ( and-g-t ( - ( and ‘([ but, ( ( s (-S ( of ( of and in so, ( [ (, ( and, or,,,, as, h t of, for (h of, (“(N ( and ( (-c d (l (-l in (d ( ( - [(ch (h ( (f ( or (c or of of and and and and-be ( and-N ( and - and of that (h-m ( ( and ( and of ( for our, ( and of of of of of of of of of of of ( ‘ – for ( ( and, [c p of –( and ( of-N of of ( of of of – of of of of of of of of of [of of [( (t of of of of of of of of of of of of-c of (t-s-t (A( ( and ( or ( and of [of-g, (d-be and-w-st (de of, ( of of ( of of of and of of of of of of ( of of of of of of-t of, ( (N (–J of, of and of over of in of de of, C (h of (c, (–in ( ( of d [ of of at of are of of of and of ( of “ of ( of ( ( in and, C ( (al for for ( of and of (of and of – of of of of of of of of of of our of of of of of of of of, of of of of of of of of-e of, of L of in ‘ – and in, of C, and, [of “e-s-of of “c of ( of “( (, and and “ of of of of “ of of, of of of of of of of of in, of, and “ of and, of, of of of the C, of, of [th ( (( (((e, of, S – and of G of"}
