{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "The capital of a bank is a buffer to absorb losses and meet regulatory requirements.  Bank capital is made up of shareholders' equity (common stock) and retained earnings.  In the case of a bank, customer deposits are an unsecured claim on the bank's assets and are therefore considered a liability.  Banks are required to hold capital as a buffer to absorb losses and meet regulatory requirements.  Banks cannot use deposit liabilities as capital because in the case of bank failure, depositor liabilities rank ahead of common stock."}

{"id": "koala_8", "prompt": "Can you write a short story where Hildibrand Manderville somehow gets transformed into Gandalf the Grey and he must work with The Warrior of Light and Nashu to restore his regular, most gentlemanly form. ", "answer": "Hildibrand Manderville, being a young man of great wealth and title, had always been a gentleman at all times.  His mother had taught him since he was a boy that a gentleman was someone who was always polite and courteous.  And so even though Gandalf the Grey, the Warrior of Light, and Nashu were all on a quest to restore the old gods in the land of Middle-earth, Hildibrand Manderville had decided to join them on the journey.  During the journey, they were in the land of Eradûn, near the Grey Mountains.  During the night, an evil force had possessed the form of Gandalf the Grey, and had turned him into a wizard of great power.  The wizard, however, did not have the power to take Gandalf's true form, since Gandalf was one with the eagles, and so had become an eagle himself.  Hildibrand Manderville, being a great warrior, had noticed this, and had fought the wizard to the death.  However, the wizard had transformed into Nashu, the bear, and had killed Hildibrand Manderville.  Nashu, however, had not been able to take the form of Gandalf the Grey, and therefore, the spirit of Gandalf the Grey was always present in the body of Nashu, the bear.  The spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then set out on a journey to the Grey Havens to ask the eagles to take him to the land of Valinor.  Along the way, Nashu the bear, and the Warrior of Light, had followed Gandalf the Grey, and they had come to the forest of Fangorn.  While in the forest, the spirit of Gandalf the Grey had noticed that Nashu the bear also had the spirit of Hildibrand Manderville, and that the warrior of light had the spirit of Gandalf the Grey.  The spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then joined with the spirit of Hildibrand Manderville, and the spirit of Gandalf the Grey had merged with the spirit of Nashu the bear.  However, because the spirit of Gandalf the Grey was always present in the body of Nashu the bear, they were unable to take the form of Gandalf the Grey, and instead, had transformed into a wizard.  The wizard, therefore, was now present in the body of Nashu the bear.  The spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then left the body of Nashu the bear, and had returned to the body of Hildibrand Manderville.  The spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then returned to the body of Nashu the bear, since the spirit of Nashu the bear was now Hildibrand Manderville.  The spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then left the body of Nashu the bear, because the spirit of Nashu the bear was now Hildibrand Manderville.  The spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then returned to the body of Nashu the bear, whose body was now Hildibrand Manderville.  And so the spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then left the body of Nashu the bear, whose body was now Hildibrand Manderville.  The spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then returned to the body of Nashu the bear, whose body was now Hildibrand Manderville.  And so the spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then left the body of Nashu the bear, whose body was now Hildibrand Manderville.  The spirit of Gandalf the Grey had then returned to the body of Nashu the bear, whose body was now Hildibrand Manderville.

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": ". in the or (d, in.. me in my (t to t in (C (ex and, at ((d (ex t -h-dis per self by me (c or 're in-h, un in me pr to at to to to to to to to and s and \"s st of of of, of s ar of, (in.

He states that markets are most efficient at pricing long term assets, such as bonds and stocks. This is because these assets can be easily measured and compared with one another, so it is easy for market participants to trade them. However, it is more difficult to measure and compare assets that are riskier or less liquid, such as options, currencies or commodities. Therefore, these assets are more expensive, as the price is a reflection of the risk associated with trading them. However, Taleb argues that in the short term, the price of any asset is a random variable, which means that there is no way to predict the price based on the past price movements of the asset. Therefore, Taleb states that markets are inefficient at pricing short term assets."}

People tend to form bonds with those who they have something in common with, have a similar outlook on life, or like similar things.  So, if a boy and a girl do not have these things in common, then they probably do not have a close relationship.  If they do have these things in common, then they are more likely to be interested in each other romantically or sexually."}

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions.

We have also notified impacted users and are providing them with free credit monitoring and other protection services.\n\nWe are extremely sorry that this happened. While we are still learning the details, we believe that human error and a lack of accountability allowed this attack to occur.\n\nWe realize that this incident impacts your trust in Reddit, and we are committed to earning it back. We have updated our security practices, and will continue to improve them as threats evolve.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience as we work through this."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "  andors  andice  andition  iter  topic 1-  andices ices 2.  program  bifies  t "}

However, since we are not, the distance between the current position of the moon and the point north of us is slightly longer than the distance between the equator and the point directly north of the equator. The angle of the moon's position to the horizon is called the elevation of the moon, and this is a spherical function. At the equator, the elevation is 1/2 of the angle between the local vertical and the center of the Earth. Since the moon is moving farther north, its elevation is going to be greater than this. Since the moon travels faster than the earth rotates, it crosses the sky in a day. The elevation of the moon at the instant of moonrise is going to be the distance between the current position of the moon and the north pole divided by the distance between the moon and the earth. The distance between the earth and the moon is 384,400 km, and the distance between the moon and the north pole is 6,371 km. Therefore, the elevation of the moon at the instant of moonrise is approximately 6,000 km/384,400 km, or 0.165 degrees.

{"id": "koala_59", "prompt": "How can anti-deressants make people think or act suicidally? Suicidal thoughts or actions' are a side effect of every single anti-depressant I've seen. Is the medicine controlling your mind or something?", "answer": "Anti-depressants are designed to help people who are experiencing depression. Depression is a mental illness and people who suffer from it often do not have the same mental state as other people.  For example, a person who is depressed does not find joy in the same things as a person who is not depressed.  In other words, depression changes the way you think.  Anti-depressants help people with depression by changing the way their brain chemistry works.  This in turn can help them with their depression.\n\nUnfortunately, these drugs do not work for everyone and they can have side effects.  One common side effect is suicidal thoughts or actions.  This is because the way the person's brain chemistry works has changed and this change can make them think about things differently.  For example, a person who wasn't suicidal before may suddenly start thinking about how much better their life would be without them in it."}

Currently, there are more than 20 legal online casino operators in India. However, since these online casinos are owned and operated by foreign companies, the online gambling laws in India are not very clear.

According to this law, gambling in India is legal if carried out in private. However, the government has not clarified if playing at online casinos from within India is considered as \"private\" or \"public\" gambling.

He had used the Force to track the Jedi to the planet, and now he was close enough to strike.  The Jedi is seated at a table with a beautiful woman, a man in a tuxedo, and another man who looks like a bounty hunter.  The woman is flirting with the Jedi, while the bounty hunter is speaking in a rough, rumbling voice about how they are going to partake in some illicit activities.  Anakin is enraged by the Jedi's apparent hypocrisy.  The woman notices Anakin and calls out to him.  \"Anakin!  Is that you?\" she says, smiling.  \"Of course it's me,\" he says, looking at her with disgust.  \"I'm so glad you could join us.  This is my friend, Aveska, her husband Lord Vader, and that's my bounty hunter friend Boba Fett.\"  The woman, Aveska, gasps, and Lord Vader stands up.  \"What is the meaning of this?\" he demands.  \"Anakin, I thought we agreed to stay away from each other,\" says Aveska.  \"And I thought we agreed to never speak of our relationship,\" replies Anakin.  \"But I'm afraid I must insist that you do both of those things,\" says Vader.  \"I've come to take you back to the Jedi Council, and you're going to like it!\"  \"Oh, Anakin, please!\" says Aveska.  \"You always were such a rule follower.  We both know you can't resist temptation, though, and I've always been much too tempting for you.\"  Anakin stares at her, seething.  \"I've come to take you back to the Jedi Council,\" says Vader.  \"What?  No!\" says Aveska.  \"You can't do this, Anakin!  You love me, remember?\"  She leans in and kisses him.  \"I love you too, Aveska,\" says Anakin.  \"It's just that, you know, I'm a Jedi, and it would be bad to break our vow of celibacy.\"  Lord Vader snarls with rage.  \"Such rules are for weaklings!  I'm your Sith Lord, and I shall have what I want!\"  He lunges at Anakin, but his bounty hunter friend Boba Fett steps in the way.  \"I wouldn't do that, Lord Vader,\" he says.  \"Because I'm your bounty hunter friend, Boba Fett.\"  Boba Fett punches Vader in the stomach, knocking him off balance.  \"Now take your Sith Lord and go,\" says Fett.  Vader gets up, grabs Aveska by the arm, and drags her out of the cantina.  \"I'll be back for you, Anakin,\" she cries.

When you buy stock, you are buying a share of the ownership of the business.  When the business makes a profit, usually after paying all of its bills, the owners of the business, also known as shareholders, get a portion of the profit.  That portion of the profit is called a dividend.  The stock market is where you buy and sell stock.  The stock market allows shareholders to buy and sell their stock to each other.  When you buy stock in a business, you are buying a claim on a portion of the future profits of the business.  As more people want to buy the stock, the price of the stock will increase.  When less people want to buy the stock, the price of the stock will decrease.  When the price of the stock goes down low enough, you may want to sell your stock to another shareholder.  When you sell your stock, you are no longer a shareholder, you are just a seller.  The money you received for selling your stock comes from the money other shareholders are willing to pay for a portion of the ownership of the business.  When all of the shareholders have sold their stock, the business is now owned by the new set of shareholders.  All of the money generated from the business now goes to the new shareholders.  As the new shareholders receive profits from the business, they will either reinvest the money into the business or pay a dividend to the shareholders."}

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Elemente Method is a numerical technique to solve differential equations. It is a very powerful method that can be used to solve many kinds of problems in Engineering and Science.\n\nIn the Finite Elemente Method, a problem is modeled as a differential equation that describes how a certain quantity changes in time. The solution of the differential equation is the function that represents the behavior of the quantity of interest as a function of time. For example, a simple harmonic oscillator is modeled as a differential equation that describes how the displacement of a spring changes in time. The solution of this equation is the function that describes the position of the spring as a function of time.\n\nThe Finite Elemente Method is an approximation of this equation. Instead of considering the whole spring, we consider only a small part of it. We assume that the behavior of this small part is the same as the behavior of the whole spring, and we approximate the solution of the differential equation by a polynomial that depends on the coordinates of this small part of the spring. This kind of approximation is called a \"finite element\" because we only consider a \"finite\" number of these small parts of the spring."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": "h, [C, the, stive, (p,"}

In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

Cats are one of the most popular animals on the internet, and have their own following of people who are obsessed with them. If you are a cat owner or enthusiast, you have probably spent hours watching cute cat videos on the internet. Cats are often associated with a few different traits and stereotypes, like being lazy, mysterious, and aloof. Cat owners will often tell you that these stereotypes are not accurate, and that cats are very intelligent and have complex personalities. There is a lot of debate among cat owners as to which breeds of cats are the best, and which ones are the most cuddly and friendly. While some people love fat cats with huge fluffy coats, other people prefer sleek and athletic cats like the Bengal cat. If you are a cat owner, you probably have your own strong opinions on this topic, and you probably have a favorite breed of cat. Here is a list of some of the most popular breeds of cats in the world: Persian cats, Siamese cats, British Shorthair cats, Bengal cats, Maine Coon cats, Ragdoll cats, American Shorthair cats, Abyssinian cats, Manx cats, Birman cats, Himalayan cats, Devon Rex cats, Scottish Fold cats, Exotic Shorthair cats, Russian Blue cats, Oriental Shorthair cats, Japanese Bobtail cats, and Australian Mist cats."}

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "The first thing would be to question the idea that aikido is about fighting. It is not about fighting but about harmony, so it would be more accurate to speak of harmonizing. This is the first teaching of Krishnamurti.\n\nThe second thing is to question the idea of a teacher. Krishnamurti says we are all teachers and students at the same time. It would be more appropriate to speak of the practice in aikido.\n\nThe third is to question the role of a master. Master means one who knows, but does not know means one who is constantly learning. This is again the teaching of Krishnamurti.\n\nThe fourth is to question the role of the dojo. The dojo is a place to practice, but where to practice? It is better to speak of where to do the practice. The dojo is a place in which to do the practice.\n\nThe fifth is to question the role of the belt. The belt is used to distinguish between different levels of practice, but what does this distinction mean? It is better to speak of different levels of practice.\n\nThe sixth is to question the role of the grading. The grading is a moment to observe the level of practice. It is better to speak of the observation of the level of practice.\n\nThe seventh is to question the role of the attacker. The attacker is a tool to observe the level of practice, but what does the attacker mean? It is better to speak of the observation of the level of practice through the attacker.\n\nThe eighth is to question the role of the uke. The uke is the target of the practice, but what is the target? It is better to speak of the object of the practice.\n\nThe ninth is to question the role of the instructor. The instructor is the one who gives parameters for the practice, but what are the parameters? It is better to speak of the objectives of the practice.\n\nThe tenth is to question the role of the martial aspect. The martial aspect is an aspect of aikido which is used to defend oneself, but what is defense? It is better to speak of the protection of what is vulnerable.\n\nThe eleventh is to question the role of the technique. The technique is a method to perform a movement, but what is the movement? It is better to speak of the action.\n\nThe last is to question the role of the weapons. The weapons are used to develop the technique, but what is the technique? It is better to speak of the action.\n\nFinally, the twelfth is to question the role of the physical aspect. The physical aspect is a key aspect of aikido practice, but what is the physical aspect? It is better to speak of the manifestation of the action."}

It was intended to be a \"one stop shop\" for all key data points, and provide insights into how the team is performing each month across different dimensions. I really appreciate all the time you've taken to help me understand the team and the business, and how you've been so open to my questions. I would love your feedback on this dashboard.\n\n1) First, a general observation, the data points and visualizations aren't organized in a way that is easy to understand. I would suggest starting with the \"High-Level\" section, and then drilling down into further details.\n2) The color scheme isn't uniform, and some of the visualizations use dark colors, which can make it hard to read the data points. Would it be okay if we used a more light-colored scheme?\n3) Some of the visualizations could be more intuitive to understand. For example, the \"Total Revenue\" bar chart is helpful, but I don't understand the difference between the \"New\" and \"Returning\" columns. Would it be helpful to add some labels to explain this?\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed working with you on this dashboard, and hope that you find it useful!

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes.\n\nA double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window. This is because in a double pane window, the air space between the two panes acts as an insulator, reducing heat transfer and cold transfer. However, a single pane window can be more efficient than a double pane window. This is because the presence of a second pane increases the weight of the window, which increases the weight that must be counterbalanced by the window mechanism, reducing the window's energy efficiency."}

In a 2015 piece in The New York Times, Fanon and Zizek are cited as theorists of \"aesthetic violence\" who believe that the only way for those marginalized by the status quo to be heard is through violence. In Kahane's speech, he describes the establishment's response to the murder of 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh as \"aesthetic violence\" - a term he coins as an oversensitivity to the use of the term \"Jewish\" which is seen as an attack on the establishment.

As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals.\"", "answer": "Many types of black people have different cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, African and African American cultures share a common ancestry and history of struggles but have distinct cultural identities. While both groups are considered Black, they have different experiences, records, and cultural practices. As Saint Augustine said, “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better. As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals.\n\nAfrican American culture has a rich history that has been shaped by the experiences of enslavement and oppression. Many African Americans have ancestors who were brought to the Americas as slaves. As a result, many cultural practices and traditions were developed to cope with the circumstances of slavery. These practices include storytelling, music, and food. For example, spirituals and gospel music are rooted in the African American experience and are used to tell stories of hope and perseverance. African American food is also influenced by the need for sustenance and survival, and is often associated with soul food. Soul food is hearty, flavorful, and economical. Some examples of soul food include fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, and collard greens. Although these practices and traditions were developed under adverse conditions, they have become intricate parts of the African American culture and experience.\n\nOn the other hand, African cultures have diverse and rich histories that are often intertwined with European, Asian, and Arab influences. Although most African cultures share similarities, they each have distinctive practices and traditions. For example, West African cultures are often associated with Yoruba or Igbo cultures. Yoruba and Igbo cultures are both based in Nigeria, and share similar practices and traditions. These practices include storytelling, music, and food. However, each culture has their own unique traditions and practices. For example, the Yoruba religion, Ifa, is one of the most popular religions in Nigeria. In contrast, most Igbo people are Christian or practice a combination of Christianity and traditional African religions. Although these two cultures share similarities, they each have distinct characteristics that make them unique.\n\nAlthough African American and African cultures share a common ancestry and history, they each have distinct experiences and practices. However, they both have rich histories that have been shaped by their experiences and are still relevant today. By understanding the similarities and differences between these cultures, we can learn more about each other and understand the world from different perspectives."}

", "answer": "Upstream by Dan Heath is about a concept called “The Ladder of Inference.” It is the idea that when we experience an emotion or have a thought, we don’t simply come to that conclusion based on logic or evidence. Instead, it is a process of “quick and dirty” thinking that starts with something we observe, then we make assumptions and draw inferences from those assumptions. It is a very human way of thinking, but it is also flawed when it comes to large-scale change. The book provides 3 strategies to overcome the Ladder of Inference:\n1.\tMove from the Truth to the Story - When something goes wrong, we tend to focus on the facts and on finding who is to blame. Moving from the truth to the story involves finding the story behind the facts and to understand the emotions and the hopes of the people involved.\n2.\tTell a New Story - Once you find the story, you have to tell a new story that aligns the facts with the emotions and the hopes of the people involved. The new story should also have a clear call to action.\n3.\tMake the New Story Irresistible - Once the new story is told, you have to make sure that the new story is irresistible, so people want to take action. This is done by using tools like rhetoric, framing, counter-frames, and social norms.\nWhat Upstream does is take these 3 strategies and apply them to social change. They apply the strategies to a school district to increase school attendance and they also apply them to a city to reduce crime. They show how the strategies can be applied at different levels: individual, organization, community, and society. What is so powerful about the book is that the strategies are so simple, yet so effective. They provide a powerful framework for social change."}

Carbon fiber is very strong, stiff, and lightweight.  It is used in buildings to construct structural beams and columns.  Carbon fibers are also used in building construction for reinforcement, to add strength to concrete.\n\nAnother common use of carbon fibers in buildings is in the insulation of buildings.  Carbon fibers are used in the manufacture of rigid foam insulation, which is used in the walls and roofs of buildings.  Carbon fibers are used to add strength and rigidity to the foam.\n\nCarbon fibers are also used in the manufacture of composite panels, which are used as siding on buildings.  These panels are made from a mixture of resin and reinforced with carbon fibers.  The combination of the resin and the carbon fibers makes the panels strong and rigid, as well as waterproof."}
{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "1. High population growth: Africa has the highest population growth rate in the world (2.5% per year compared with 0.9% in Asia and 1% in Europe). This is putting strain on the continent’s fragile ecosystems and the ability of its agricultural sector to increase production.\n2. Low agricultural productivity: Agricultural productivity in Africa is only 2/3 of the world average and less than half of the productivity in Asia.\n3. Poor rural infrastructure and inadequate access to markets: Agricultural production is constrained by poor rural infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation and storage facilities, and inadequate access to markets. Some 60% of the rural population in Africa does not have access to an all-season road that is more than 500 metres long.\n4. Insufficient and unreliable rainfall: Climate change is increasing the variability of rainfall patterns, making it more difficult for farmers to predict their harvests.\n5. High price volatility: Price volatility, due to international price shocks, has a negative impact on food security and the agricultural sector.\n6. Lack of investment: Agricultural investment in Africa is low, at only 2-3% of GDP compared with an average of 7% in Asia and 4% in Latin America.\n7. High costs of doing business: Doing business in Africa is expensive compared with other regions, making it difficult for the private sector to invest in the agricultural sector.\n8. Poor rural financial inclusion: Rural populations in Africa have limited access to financial services, limiting their ability to invest in the agricultural sector.\n9. Inadequate agricultural research and training: Agricultural research and training institutions are underfunded and not keeping pace with the challenges facing the agricultural sector.\n10. Lack of political will: The agricultural sector is not a political priority in Africa, and progress has been slow in addressing the challenges facing the sector."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is a threat because it could change global temperatures and climate patterns by as much as 11 degrees fahrenheit, which could disrupt food production and weather patterns around the world.  Climate change is caused by humans burning fossil fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the planet to warm.  There is currently a lot of political debate about whether or not climate change is real, and there is even less consensus about what to do about it, but most scientists agree that it is happening, and that humans are at least partially responsible.  The most important thing that we can do to stop climate change is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, and find alternative sources of energy like wind and solar power.  There are also a lot of steps that individuals can take to reduce their personal energy consumption and carbon footprint, like using energy efficient lightbulbs, washing clothes in cold water, and driving less."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "The main reason is that TV episodes are broken down into smaller segments. Each segment is roughly 20 to 25 minutes long. The segments in a film are usually 90 minutes long. So watching 3 hours of TV can feel like less work than watching a 3-hour film. The reason is, after 90 minutes, our mind starts to drift. It starts to think about other things and we lose focus on the film. After 20 minutes, our mind remains focused on the film. This is because our brain has a limited capacity to process information. It can only focus on a single topic for 90 minutes before having to shift its focus elsewhere."}

Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.\n\nWhat were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "Based on Adichie's story, three motifs that were found to be present were: American Dream/Disillusionment, Power, and Stereotypes. \n\nThe American Dream/Disillusionment motif was present because Chike, the main character in the story, moves to America with the belief that he will be able to fulfill his version of the American Dream. However, after being in America for a few weeks, he starts to notice that the reality of America is not quite what he was expecting. As a result, he begins to question whether he made the right decision in coming to America in the first place.\n\nThe Power motif was also present because although Chike is a fairly intelligent and hard-working person, he is still just a 16-year-old boy who has never lived outside of Nigeria before. As a result, he is easily manipulated by the other boys at school, who are able to take advantage of him because of this. However, later in the story, once Chike realizes that his power is limited, he is able to use it to his advantage. \n\nFinally, the Stereotypes motif was present because throughout the story, Chike makes a number of observations about Americans, as well as about African people. \nFor example, he notices that many people in America seem to be very concerned about guns, as if everyone in America has one. He also notices that people in America are not nearly as skinny as they are in Africa, and he thinks to himself that this must be because they are eating too much. He also notices that people in America are very interested in sports, particularly basketball, and he thinks to himself that this must be because African people are not very athletic. Although these are just a few of the stereotypes that Chike notices about Americans and African people, we can clearly see that stereotypes were a major theme throughout the story."}

{"id": "koala_164", "prompt": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?", "answer": "Metal surfaces emit light over a range of wavelengths, and the spectrum of this light is characteristic of the metal. The emitted light is often in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, but light of other wavelengths, including infrared and ultraviolet, may also be emitted. The wavelengths of light emitted are a function of the temperature of the metal's surface. At room temperature, most metals emit light primarily in the visible range. As the temperature of the metal increases, the peak emission moves toward the infrared region of the spectrum. When the metal is heated enough to glow red, it emits light across the visible spectrum, and as it becomes white-hot it emits light across the entire visible spectrum plus most of the infrared spectrum."}

It was not illegal for Russia to annex the Crimea.  Crimea was a part of Russia until 1954 when it was given to the Ukraine.  The Russian people did not want to be governed by the Ukraine.

The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it may be related to an immune system response to an inhaled substance, such as an antigen.\n\nIn sarcoidosis, small collections of inflammatory cells called granulomas form in various organs, but they usually do not cause damage to the organs.\n\nSymptoms of sarcoidosis depend on the organs affected, but may include: shortness of breath, a dry cough, a sore red eye, fatigue, joint swelling, or a skin rash.\n\nDiagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on a person's medical history and a physical exam. Tests that may be used to help diagnose sarcoidosis include: imaging studies, such as a chest x-ray or CT scan; a biopsy of an affected organ; or a blood test to measure levels of an antibody called an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA).\n\nTreatment of sarcoidosis typically includes medications to relieve symptoms and reduce inflammation, such as corticosteroids. In some people, sarcoidosis may go away on its own.\n\nSarcoidosis affects about 1 in 2,500 people in the United States. It is more common in African American and Northern European people, and may be more severe in African American people."}

The man will have to save $1000 per month for 12 months to have $12,000 (12 * $1000). The man will also need $8000 - $2000 = $6000.

Include claims on detailed processes involved, system architecture and algorithms", "answer": "A digital certificate is an electronic mechanism for binding an identity to a public key, and verifying the binding through a signature on the certificate by a trusted authority. It enables the entity that owns the identity to prove possession of the private key associated with the public key. It is commonly used for authentication (e.g. for email) and for providing a digital signature.\n\nA digital certificate is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) and binds a public key to an identity (e.g. an email address, organization, or person). It also contains information about the identity and a signature from the CA. The signature allows verifying the binding and origin of the certificate. To trust a certificate, one needs to trust the CA, which relies on a trust model that is based on a hierarchical or a distributed model.\n\nA digital certificate is a type of digital document that is stored on a computer and used to establish a person or service's identity over a network, such as the Internet. It is created by a trusted third-party certificate authority and binds the person or service's name to its public key. A public key can be used to verify the identity of the person or service presenting it and to ensure the message has not been altered in transit.\n\nTraditionally, certificates were issued on paper and used to bind a public key to a person's or organization's name. Later, X.509 digital certificates were introduced that use public-key cryptography to bind a public key to a name and are digitally signed by a certificate authority (CA) to ensure the binding is valid. The certificate includes the name or other identifier of the entity the certificate identifies, the public key of the entity, the signature of the CA, and other information.\n\nCertificates are used to build the PKI (public key infrastructure) model, which relies on a hierarchy of CAs that issue certificates and sign each other's certificates to build trust and allow for the creation of a chain of trust. This trust is derived from the CA's reputation, as well as the legal contracts and audit processes that underpin the issuance of certificates."}
{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " (t (c [c [c (cou (c [-(a (one (c-and for the (c, or (d (-t of ([(c (b (d-c of c of ( of of ch of a of, our of (c of al of (n t, t of the, them, ch (c, (d, and ar of our, ch ar of (d, (c and w (s - (n of, [t of of of [h of of the of – -n:th, it, for out (h, r-this, – people, people-h of n of (, (b ( and, (h, – (c in [c of (C of (b of n of no, co-c, (c to (ch-a (s,.
