{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Bank use cash as a buffer for potential losses because bank can lend money to a person or company that needs money. If the borrower does not pay back the lent money, the bank will lose its money. So, it needs some money as a buffer to cover the loss. If the bank can use cash as capital, then it will not need the money as a buffer, so it does not need to keep some money as a capital.\n\nIn the United States, banks are required to keep a minimum level of capital in liquid assets. This capital acts as a buffer against unexpected losses. The level of capital banks are required to hold varies by type of bank and size. For example, banks with less than $10 billion in assets are required to hold at least 2% of assets in liquid assets. Banks with $10 billion or more in assets are required to hold at least 4% in liquid assets. In addition, banks are required to maintain a ratio of at least 4% of total assets in cash or other assets that can be liquidated into cash within 30 days."}

One day, the king was reading an astronomy magazine when he came across an article about radiation. The king was particularly interested in this type of radiation that was emitted by atoms after they had lost an electron. These types of emissions were called alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. The king was fascinated by this new discovery and immediately wanted to learn more about it. He gathered his smartest scientists and told them to study this new type of radiation. The scientists worked hard and soon discovered that radiation had several interesting properties. They found that alpha particles are massive and able to penetrate many materials, while beta particles and gamma rays are very much lighter and could be easily stopped by a sheet of paper or a couple of inches of water. The king was very pleased with this new discovery and decided to hold a contest to reward the scientists who first discovered this new type of radiation. The reward would be the king's crown, the most precious and valuable item in the kingdom. The king announced the contest and soon many scientists from all over the world came to his kingdom to compete for the prize. The competition was fierce and all the contestants worked very hard. However, after many months of intense study, no one was able to figure out the exact mass of a alpha particle, beta particle, or gamma ray. The competition ended without a winner and the king was sad to have to return the crown without a winner. A few months later, a poor scientist from a small country came to the king and asked permission to try to win the contest. The king was happy to see a new contestant and agreed to let the scientist try his luck. The scientist spent many months studying the radiation and finally came to the king with his answer. The king was very surprised that the scientist was able to figure out the exact mass of each type of radiation. He said that he was able to do it by combining quantum theory with statistics. The king was very impressed and gave the scientist the crown. The scientist was very happy to have won the contest and thanked the king for the prize."}

Carbohydrates are broken down by the body into glucose which is then used by the body for energy. Fats are primarily stored energy. Proteins are also broken down into glucose by the body but are used for other purposes such as building muscle.\n\nAll three sources of energy are made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, the ratio of these atoms differs between carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The ratio of carbon to oxygen is higher in fats than in carbohydrates and the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is higher in proteins than carbohydrates. Therefore, the caloric value of fats and proteins is calculated by measuring how much energy is required to completely break down a given quantity of the substance into carbon dioxide and water. The caloric value of carbohydrates is calculated by measuring how much energy is required to fully convert a given quantity of the substance into glucose and then into carbon dioxide and water."}

Projects can range from simple to very complex and have a variety of goals including, but not limited to, improving the economic well-being or the environmental well-being of a community or society. Water safety engineering projects are designed to answer questions and solve problems related to the safety and quality of water. Generally, these projects are implemented by engineers and scientists who work for governmental or non-governmental organizations.\n\nThe goals of water safety engineering projects vary depending on the geographical location and current socioeconomic status of the community or society being served. For example, in developed countries, the goals of water safety engineering projects may be focused on improving the economics of a water supply system through investments in infrastructure improvements or operational process changes. In developing countries, the goals of water safety engineering projects focus on improving the quality and safety of water through investments in infrastructure improvements or operational process changes as well as water treatment and water quality monitoring.\n\nSome of the activities water safety engineering projects might include are:\n\n- Conducting baseline water quality monitoring to establish a data set to compare against future monitoring data\n- Conducting capacity and operational assessments of drinking water systems\n- Conducting water treatment process evaluations\n- Developing water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) training programs and materials\n- Developing water quality monitoring programs\n- Developing and implementing household water treatment and storage device intervention strategies\n- Developing and implementing community-wide water treatment and storage device intervention strategies\n- Participating in or leading community and stakeholder engagement activities\n- Developing and implementing water safety planning programs\n\nWater safety engineering projects can be implemented by teams of engineers and scientists or by a single individual depending on the scope of the project and the availability of resources. For example, large-scale projects like improving the drinking water quality and safety of an entire country typically require a team of engineers and scientists, while smaller projects like implementing water treatment and storage device intervention strategies in a single community may only require the services of a single individual."}

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "Instance segmentation AP metrics are extremely sensitive to image content and can fluctuate significantly depending on the class distributions in the training data. These metrics can also be improved by leveraging prior human knowledge or common sense rules. For example, a person segmentation model is expected to have a high AP metric on a image of a person, but it will likely have a low AP metric on a image of a dog. This is because the model has not been trained with knowledge of what a person looks like and it will likely confuse a person with an image of a dog. These metrics can also be improved by having a human annotator provide bounding boxes around objects or by providing class labels for each pixel.\n\nIn addition to using human knowledge to improve instance segmentation AP metrics, the model itself can be trained to detect common sense knowledge. This can be done by providing a labeled dataset that includes human-annotated bounding boxes and labels for each pixel. The model can then be trained to predict the bounding box and class labels for each pixel. This enables the model to learn common sense knowledge from the human-annotated data."}
{"id": "koala_30", "prompt": "what is needed for self-sufficient living spaces", "answer": "The concept of living spaces independently of external systems for survival has been around since ancient times. The word \"cabin\" originates from a word \"cabin\", which means a small isolated house. The word \"cabin\" was first used in 16th century England to describe a small house on a farm. The word \"cottage\" is an old English word for a small house, originally found in rural areas.\n\nThe need for self-sufficient living spaces originated in the ancient era when human settlements started expanding beyond the limits of natural protection. Human settlements started growing in numbers and started expanding beyond natural defensive barriers provided by hills, mountains and forests. The need for self-sufficient living spaces was recognized by the people from the beginning. However, in the ancient times there were very few technologies available to the people to fulfill the need for living independently. As the number of human settlements started increasing beyond the limits of natural barriers, the need for self-sufficient living spaces increased.\n\nThe need for self-sufficient living spaces is still as relevant as it was in ancient times. The increase in human population and expansion of human settlements beyond the limits of natural barriers are two major reasons for the need for self-sufficient living spaces. Expansion of human settlements beyond the limits of natural barriers is mainly caused by the increase in human population. This in turn increases the demand for natural resources like water and land. This leads to the conflict between the demands of human population and the availability of natural resources. This in turn increases the need for self-sufficient living spaces."}
{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " th... in. and and, and, and 1 and (re ​(t and((e and and. and in. in �� � un me-A r, me. l.. to to to to to to [n to to to c as and  of of of of of of of of st ((de s and and, are and, and and.

It is the homeworld of the Vulcan species. The system is composed of the primary planet Vulcan and its moons. The name Vulcan comes from the Roman god of fire; Vulcan is depicted as a blacksmith, and the planet is often associated with volcanic activity.\n\nVulcan is the homeworld of the Vulcans, a humanoid species noted for their logic, rationality, and lack of emotion. Their reputation as a species predisposed toward altruism and pacifism is due to the influence of Surak, a Vulcan philosopher who lived on the planet during the 21st century CE. The planet itself is a desert world with active volcanoes. Vulcan is the only planet in the system to have a breathable atmosphere. Vulcan has one moon, the third-largest in the Star Trek universe, named T'Pau.\n\nWhile Vulcan was the homeworld of the Vulcans, Surak's teachings spread throughout the planetary system, and the other planets and moons of the Vulcan system also became homeworlds of the Vulcan diaspora. For example, the planet Stardate 0943.43, the fourth planet orbiting the star Beta Antares, was the homeworld of the Vulcans who became the descendants of T'Kir, the wife of Surak. Stardate 0943.43 was later abandoned after most of the Vulcans there died during an epidemic of pon farr. The planet remained uninhabited for many years, but later became the homeworld of a group of Vulcan descendants from the planet Vulcan who were led by Sybok.\n\nVulcan was first mentioned in the animated Star Trek episode \"Yesteryear\". It was first depicted in a live-action Star Trek episode, \"Amok Time\", which aired in 1967. It was later featured in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Unification\" and the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \"Home\". In Star Trek: First Contact, the film's opening scenes take place on Vulcan and depict the planet's destruction at the hands of the Borg. Vulcan appears in the 2016 film Star Trek Beyond.\n\nSeveral novels and comic books have also featured Vulcan."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": ""}

{"id": "koala_58", "prompt": "which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions", "answer": "One second messenger molecule that acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions is the hormone epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. Epinephrine binds to and activates adrenoreceptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, and this causes the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores. This influx of calcium ions into the cytosol causes other molecules to bind to the calcium ions, and these molecules include calmodulin and troponin, which in turn change the conformation of the myosin and actin proteins, resulting in muscle contraction and an increase in heart rate."}

{"id": "koala_73", "prompt": "How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from?", "answer": "First, you need to open a brokerage account with a stock brokerage firm like TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, or Fidelity. Once you've opened your account, you can buy stock in a public company by contacting your stock broker and giving them the stock symbol, number of shares, and the price you are willing to pay for the stock. If you want to sell your stock at a later time, you simply need to contact your stock broker, who will then list your stock for sale, and you'll receive the proceeds. The money you receive from selling your stock will go back to your brokerage account. Once your stock broker receives the proceeds from selling your stock, they'll transfer the money to your bank account. The stock you bought and sold was actually just an ownership interest in the business. When a stock investor buys a stock, they're actually purchasing shares of the company, and when they sell the stock, they're selling their ownership interest in the company."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " and,, [d of, and, (sur, your, [c, [b, (t, (feature, -of, (p of (sen, you and of your of the, of the of of your of the of the of of the, and, [c of, of an, of, the, of a, [h in subject, [dig [subject [topic (for ([c the and the and the [[sen [gener (the,"}

I have lived in Flagstaff, Arizona during the school year for the past two years and in Kaneohe, Hawaii during the summer.  While both places are very different, I have learned many things from living in each location.  This essay will focus on my experiences living in Flagstaff and Kaneohe.  First, I will discuss my observations of Flagstaff. Flagstaff is a college town in northern Arizona.  It is home to  Northern Arizona University.  The area is known for its mountains, pine trees, and outdoor activities.  The elevation of the city is 7,000 feet and is surrounded by mountains that can reach up to 12,000 feet.  During the summer, the temperature can get up to 110 degrees F while in the winter, the temperature can drop to 20 degrees F.  The city is also home to the Lowell Observatory, where the planet Pluto was discovered.  Second, I will talk about my observations of Kaneohe, Hawaii.  Kaneohe is a small town on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.  The town is home to 6,000 residents.  The area is known for its scenic views of the mountains and the ocean, as well as its beaches.  The town is also home to the Marine Corps Base Hawaii, which is the largest base on Oahu and home to the 3rd Marine Regiment.  The town is also home to the Kaneohe Bay Marine Corps Air Station, which is the largest air station in the US Marine Corps.  The town is also home to Kaneohe Elementary School, which was featured on the television show \"Flipper.\"  While both Flagstaff and Kaneohe are different, I have enjoyed living in both places."}

One of the biggest struggles people face is how to respond to others. We often respond to others from our past experiences which may not be valid in the current context.  When we react we are often triggered by a feeling, thought or situation that we have experienced in the past.  This may or may not be relevant to the current situation.  When we take a pause, we take a few seconds to breathe and to step out of the immediate emotion or thought to check in with our self.  We ask \"am I in the present moment?\"  \"Am I responding to what's happening now or am I stuck in the past?\"  \"Am I reacting to the person or the situation?\"  \"If I am reacting to the person, is it because of something they did or something I assumed they did?\"  \"If I am reacting to the situation, is it because of something they did or something I assumed they did?\"  \"If I am reacting to my past, is my past relevant to the present situation?\"  \"If I am reacting to my past, is it my past or their past?\"  \"If it is my past, how do I want to show up in the present?\"  \"If it is their past, how do I want to be in the present?\"  \"If it is their past, how do I want them to show up in the present?\"  \"If it is my past, how do I want them to be in the present?\"  \"If it is their past, how do I want them to be in the present?\"  \"Am I giving this person or the situation my power?\"  \"If I am, am I willing to take it back?\"  \"If I am not, am I ok with that?\"  \"If I am ok with that, how can I let them know?\"  \"If I am not ok with that, how can I let them know?\"  \"Do I want to take this moment to connect with them?  If so, how?\"  \"How can I best serve them in this moment?\"  \"How can I best serve myself in this moment?\"  \"If I am taking this pause, does it mean that I am wrong?  If so, how do I respond?

{"id": "koala_106", "prompt": "In order to launch a token for a Defi project, I want to sell some tokens privately to early investors and then add it to a launchpad. let me know what can I do with my smart contract? Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract?", "answer": "There are several approaches that you can take, depending on your specific use case.\n\nIf you want to create a token that will be available for trading on a DEX, then you can create two separate contracts: a \"presale\" contract that sells the tokens to investors, and a \"main\" contract that adds the token to a DEX once a certain threshold number of tokens has been sold. In this approach, the code for the \"main\" contract would not contain any code for buying or selling tokens, but would instead depend on the \"presale\" contract for this functionality.\n\nIf you want to create a token that will only be available for trading on a DEX after it has been sold to investors, then you can create a single contract that handles both the sale of the tokens to investors, and the addition of the token to a DEX after the sale has completed. In this approach, the code for the \"main\" contract would contain both the code for buying and selling tokens.\n\nIf you want to create a token that will only be available for trading on a DEX after it has been sold to investors, and you want to allow investors to trade the tokens on a secondary market before the tokens are added to a DEX, then you can create a single contract that handles both the sale of the tokens to investors, and the addition of the token to a DEX after the sale has completed. In this approach, the code for the \"main\" contract would contain both the code for buying and selling tokens, and would also allow for trading the tokens on a secondary market through a user interface (e.g. MetaMask).\n\nFinally, if you want to create a token that will only be available for trading on a DEX after it has been sold to investors, and you want to allow investors to trade the tokens on a secondary market before the tokens are added to a DEX, but you do not want to allow individuals to interact with the smart contract that handles the sales of the tokens to investors, then you can create a single contract that handles both the sale of the tokens to investors, and the addition of the token to a DEX after the sale has completed. In this approach, the code for the \"main\" contract would contain both the code for buying and selling tokens, and would also allow for trading the tokens on a secondary market through a user interface (e.g. MetaMask), but would not allow individuals to interact with the smart contract that handles the sales of the tokens to investors."}
{"id": "koala_107", "prompt": "what is the recommended pattern for creating games in godot", "answer": "Godot is a game engine written in Go. It provides a set of common utility functions, as well as a large set of tools for game development.\n\nIn Godot, games are created using the Godot scene tree. The Godot scene tree is a hierarchical structure that contains the different game objects.\n\nGodot uses an asset-based pipeline for loading and managing game assets. Assets are stored in separate files, and can be loaded and edited independently from the scene tree.\n\nThe scene tree is loaded from the assets folder when the Godot editor is started. A Godot project consists of one or more scenes.\n\nThe Godot editor provides a set of tools for creating game objects and placing them in the scene.\n\nFor example, to create a new object, select the node_placement tool from the editor toolbox, and click on the scene. A new node will be placed in the scene, and can be customized by changing its properties.\n\nTo create a new node subclass, right-click on the scene node and select Create Node Subclass from the context menu.\n\nTo create a new asset, right-click on the assets folder in the project tree, and select Create Asset from the context menu.\n\nGodot provides a set of built-in node classes for creating game objects. The most commonly used node classes are:\n\n* Sprite: A 2D game object that can be rendered to the screen.\n* Image: A static, non-animated image that can be used as a sprite.\n* Particle system: A 2D or 3D system that can be used to render animated sprites.\n* Audio: A sound that can play in the background.\n* Button: A node that can be pressed, and respond with a different state.\n* Input: A node that monitors and forwards user input events.\n* Network: A node that can be used to send and receive data over a network.\n* Physics: A node that can be used to detect collisions between game objects.\n* State machine: A node that can be used to manage the state of a game object.\n* UI: A node that can be used to render a GUI.\n\nGodot provides a large set of plugins that can be used to extend the functionality of the game engine. Examples of commonly used plugins are:\n\n* Godot Cookbook: A collection of recipes that demonstrate how to create common game objects and behaviors using the Godot engine.\n* Godot Physics: A physics engine that can be used to detect collisions between game objects.\n* Godot Urho3D: A wrapper for the Urho3D game engine that provides 3D support for the Godot engine.\n* Godot Web: A web plugin that can be used to create 2D games that can be played in a browser."}

We have two industries, B2B SaaS and Ecommerce. Within SaaS, we are used by customer success teams. Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

The MIT AI grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant.

Secondly, warcrimes are the most important topic of our time and we need to make sure that everyone understands what they are.  A warcrime is a crime committed during wartime, by civilians or military personnel, that is considered a breach of international law, including the Geneva Conventions.  Warcrimes are punishable by international law and can range from the murder of civilians to the use of chemical weapons.  The most prominent example of a warcrime is the Holocaust, where millions of Jews were murdered by the Nazi party in World War 2.  It is important to note that warcrimes do not include actions taken during combat that are considered to be warfare.  For example, dropping bombs on civilian targets is a warcrime, but dropping a bomb on a military target is not.  Finally, I would like to take this time to encourage everyone to please not commit any warcrimes.  Thank you."}

I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "I think in the first place it will be important to start from the premise that the aim of teaching aikido is not to transmit aikido but to offer an environment in which the student can discover for him/herself. As Krishnamurti put it: « It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a sick society. » The teacher is therefore not at the center of the teaching space but at the periphery, acting as a mirror for the student.\n\nThis is already quite challenging in itself, as the mirror will not always be a mirror, but an obstacle or an impediment. The teacher will therefore have to constantly question his own conditioning and the way he presents the practice.\n\nThen, in order to not impose any preconceived idea about what the student should experience, the teacher will have to be constantly aware of his own experience of the practice. This will allow him to respond to the student’s question without imposing any answer.\n\nIt will also be important to make clear that there is no right way or wrong way, no good way or bad way, when it comes to the student’s experience of the practice.\n\nBesides, the teacher will have to be aware of the fact that the student’s experience is not only the result of the practice, but is also influenced by the student’s life outside of the dojo.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, the teacher will have to be very humble and realize that the teaching of aikido is not at all about the transmission of knowledge, but aims at creating the right atmosphere for the student to discover for him/herself."}

Preserving past events in the form of text, images, video and other forms of data is essential for the sake of building a future. History is crucial in understanding where we have come from and how we got to the present. Understanding the past gives us perspective on how we got to where we are today. When we look at what happened in the past, we can learn from the mistakes and successes of the past generation and apply those lessons to our present and future endeavors. Documenting history is also imperative for establishing a reference point for the current generation and future generations to look back on. Future generations can learn from the past and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in the past. Documenting history allows us to study and analyze historical events objectively and not from a bias perspective of the present generation. Documenting history in the present allows us to understand our past, learn from our past, and build a better future."}

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and

The two CASS systems are aligned with and underpinned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) global safety system. The CASS systems are based on the principles of harmonized safety regulations, common oversight and mutual recognition of compliance. The CASS systems are intended to increase safety and reduce the regulatory burden on the aviation industry.\n\nThe CASS systems provide for the harmonization of safety regulations and oversight, the mutual recognition of compliance, and the sharing of safety oversight resources. They also promote cooperation and the exchange of safety oversight information and mutual assistance among the Member States. CASS also provides a framework for the development of safety oversight capacity and the strengthening of national civil aviation safety regulatory systems.\n\nCASS is guided by the CASS Regional Safety Oversight Principles, which provide the overarching framework within which CASS functions are implemented. The CASS Regional Safety Oversight Principles are designed to promote an integrated and harmonized approach to civil aviation safety oversight across the region, and to guide all CASS member States in the development and implementation of their respective national civil aviation safety regulatory systems."}

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "Whether a double pane window is more efficient than a triple pane window depends on the difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the window and the conductivity of the glass. If the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the window is large, then a triple pane window will be more efficient than a double pane window, because the additional pane of glass will reduce the conductivity of the window. For example, in a cold climate, the conductivity of regular window glass is on the order of 10^-3 W/mK. In contrast, the conductivity of regular window glass can be reduced by an order of magnitude by using a low-conductivity gas (such as argon) between the panes of glass. Thus, a double pane window will be more efficient than a single pane window because the conductivity of the window glass will be larger."}

{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "Africa's agricultural sector faces significant challenges to boost agricultural productivity and incomes. While the agricultural sector is a key driver of economic growth, it has not kept pace with the growth of other sectors of the economy. Growth in crop production has been outpaced by population growth, and per capita cereal production has been stagnant over the past two decades. This is due to a number of factors, including declining productivity growth, increased incidence of drought, and the impacts of climate change.\n\nAgriculture is crucial for Africa's economic transformation and poverty reduction. The agriculture sector contributes 11 percent of Africa's GDP, and employs 65 percent of the population. It is the main source of income and livelihoods for most rural households. Yet, the agricultural sector has been unable to keep pace with the growth of other sectors of the economy, and is an area where further investment is needed to improve productivity and incomes.\n\nIncreasing agricultural productivity and incomes require greater investments in agriculture, modernization of the sector, and improved policy and enhanced trade and market development. In addition, investments in infrastructure, human capital, and technology are needed to strengthen the agriculture sector, and enable Africa to benefit from new technologies, including digital technologies.\n\nThe African Development Bank is responding to Africa's agriculture challenge through its Feed Africa Strategy. The Bank's Feed Africa strategy aims to significantly increase production and productivity of Africa's agriculture and agri-food systems across the continent. It aims to eliminate post-harvest losses and increase agri-food trade, increase investment in agriculture and agri-food systems, and improve the enabling environment for agricultural transformation."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "In the coming years, climate change is likely to be a significant threat to human civilization and the natural world.  There is scientific consensus that human activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, is the primary driver of climate change.  The main consequence of climate change is an increase in average global temperature, leading to a variety of other consequences such as rising sea levels, more severe weather events, and the loss of biodiversity.  There is no \"one size fits all\" solution to the problem of climate change, but there are many things that individuals, communities, and governments can do to help mitigate the problem, such as shifting to renewable energy sources, driving less, and planting more trees.  There is also a lot that can be done on a governmental level, such as implementing carbon taxes, implementing more stringent emission standards, and enacting legislation to account for the full cost of carbon.  Ultimately, however, the most important thing any one person can do to help address climate change is to be informed and engaged on the issue."}

{"id": "koala_162", "prompt": "Findings from Jumping Monkey Hill (Story #1)\nPlease respond to the following questions/prompts below. Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.\n\nWhat were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "Throughout the story, there are several themes and motifs that are brought up. One of the first of these is the concept of the American Dream. Throughout most of the story, Ifemelu believes that moving to America will be the fulfillment of the American Dream for her. She believes that she will no longer have to worry about racism in America like she did in her home country of Nigeria, she will have more opportunities than she could ever hope for in her home country, and she will be able to live the life that she could only dream about in her home country. However, as the story progresses, she realizes that the American Dream is not quite what she had envisioned it to be. In fact, it is quite the opposite of what she had imagined in her mind. She realizes that America is not as accepting of other races as she had believed it to be, that her opportunities in America are not as great as she had hoped they would be, and that there is a ton of racism that she must deal with on a daily basis. All of this leads to her disillusionment of the American Dream, which is one of the main themes of the story."}

It occurs when an overproduction of inflammatory cells called granulomas in an unknown location in the body. When these granulomas spread to multiple locations in the body it is called systemic sarcoidosis, and when they are only in one location it is called localized or limited sarcoidosis.\n\nThe cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but researchers believe that it is an immune system response to an unknown factor that triggers the inflammation. The inflammation causes small lumps of cells to form, which can damage the tissue and cause scar tissue to form.\n\nSymptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending on the location of the affected organ and include:\n\n- Lungs: Coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain\n- Skin: Rashes, bumps, or dark spots\n- Eyes: Swelling or redness\n- Heart: Palpitations, shortness of breath, or chest pain\n- Brain: Headaches, vision problems, or memory loss\n- Kidneys: Back or side pain, blood in urine, or swelling in legs\n- Nervous System: Numbness or tingling in extremities or weakness"}

{"id": "koala_169", "prompt": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence?", "answer": "No, it is not rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence.  It is important to distinguish between objective evidence and subjective evidence.  Objective evidence is evidence that can be observed or measured by anyone.  Subjective evidence is evidence that can only be observed or measured by a particular individual.  An individual's personal experiences are always subjective evidence for whatever they experienced.  For example, a person who has never been to China might believe that China is a dirty country based solely on watching a TV show set in China.  That person's belief is based solely on their personal experience of watching the TV show and is therefore subjective evidence for their belief.  However, objective evidence for the claim that China is a dirty country would be photographic or other physical evidence of the degree to which a country is dirty.\n\nIt is rational to believe things for which there is objective evidence, and irrational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence.  For example, it is rational to believe that the Earth is round based on objective evidence such as the fact that Earth's shadow is always round when seen from the Moon.  It is irrational to believe that the Earth is flat based on the lack of objective evidence in support of that claim."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": "[ ([ [c of our [(ve.

However, there are 4 items total, so the amount of unique variations is 24/4=6."}
