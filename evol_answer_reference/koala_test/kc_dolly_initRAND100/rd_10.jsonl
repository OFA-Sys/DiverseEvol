{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Bank can only use cash as a buffer for potential losses if the bank is 100% reserve bank. In a 100% reserve bank the requirement on how much liquidity a bank needs to hold against their assets is completely dependent on the liquidity of the assets a bank owns. If the assets are very liquid then the bank only needs to hold a fraction of its assets in liquid assets, like cash. But if the assets are illiquid, like a mortgage, then the bank needs to hold more liquid assets on hand as a buffer to be able to meet withdrawals on those assets. In a 100% reserve bank all deposits are backed by cash the bank holds in its vault and therefore the bank is 100% backed by cash. If everyone wanted to withdraw all their money at the same time, the bank could not pay out because it would not have the cash on hand to cover those withdrawals. In that case the bank would experience a loss and would go bankrupt. But if the bank is a fractional reserve bank then it is not 100% backed by cash which means that the bank can use cash as a buffer for potential losses. In a fractional reserve bank the amount of liquid assets a bank must hold is a fraction of it's total assets. Depending on the liquidity of the assets the bank can hold less cash on hand. If the assets are very liquid then the bank only needs to hold a fraction of its assets in liquid assets, like cash. But if the assets are illiquid, like a mortgage, then the bank needs to hold more liquid assets on hand as a buffer to be able to meet withdrawals on those assets."}

{"id": "koala_15", "prompt": "Why is it that only proteins, carbohydrates and fats are deemed to have caloric value?<br>Just to clarify - consider the hypothetical situation below:<br>100g of 'carbohydrates' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'protein' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'fat' = 900kCal<br>100g of 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes' = ?", "answer": "Firstly, it is important to understand that the caloric value of a substance refers to the amount of energy required to metabolize the substance.  The calories in a food reflect the energy content of the food, and thus can be used to calculate the amount of energy that will be obtained from eating the food.  The caloric value of a substance is a measure of how much energy a given amount of that substance will provide.\n\nTo understand why only proteins, carbohydrates and fats are deemed to have caloric value, we need to understand how our bodies use these substances.\n\nProteins, carbohydrates and fats are all used as energy sources by our bodies.  During digestion, these macronutrients are converted into usable energy by our bodies.  The amount of energy that can be obtained from a macronutrient is dependent on the substance itself, and the amount of energy required to metabolize the substance.\n\nProteins are made up of amino acids, which are used by our bodies to build and maintain cells, tissues and organs.  During digestion, proteins are broken down into their constituent amino acids.  The amount of energy required to break down a protein into its constituent amino acids is relatively high, and as a result, proteins have a low energy density.  Our bodies only need a small amount of energy to sustain themselves, and as such, proteins are only needed in small quantities.\n\nCarbohydrates are made up of sugars.  During digestion, carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is used by our bodies as a quick source of energy.  Our bodies can quickly metabolize glucose into energy, and as a result, carbohydrates have a high energy density.  They are therefore needed in larger quantities than proteins or fats.\n\nFats are composed of glycerol and fatty acids.  Like carbohydrates, they are also used as a source of energy.  However, unlike carbohydrates, fats are more energy dense, and as such are needed in smaller quantities than carbohydrates.\n\nVitamins, minerals and other electrolytes are not used as energy sources by our bodies.  Rather, they are essential for the proper functioning of our bodies.  As such, they do not have a caloric value."}

Prompt=  \n\nAfter reading Lalor’s Chapter 8 as well as Goode’s explanation of curriculum evaluation necessity and models, explain what your school does to evaluate curriculum. Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.

{"id": "koala_25", "prompt": "Write me a 2000 word essay on a water safety engineering project.", "answer": "Water is a vital resource that is necessary for life to exist. It is present in many different forms including a solid (ice), liquid, and vapor (water vapor). Water is used in many different ways including drinking, cooking, cleaning, and growing food to name a few. Because water is so vital to life, it is important that we protect it from contamination. Contaminated water can be a serious health risk to humans and animals. There are many different ways that water can become contaminated including runoff from farms, chemical spills, or improperly stored and disposed of household chemicals. \n\nOne of the biggest threats to clean water is storm water. Storm water runoff is rain water that flows over the ground and picks up contaminants as it makes its way to a body of water such as a lake or stream. Storm water can pick up many different types of contaminants including litter, oil, fertilizers, and other chemicals. These contaminants can end up in our water supply if the storm water is not contained and treated before it reaches the water supply.\n\nAn example of a water safety engineering project is constructing concrete storm water detention ponds. Concrete storm water detention ponds are constructed to capture and hold storm water runoff and prevent it from contaminating our water supply.

{"id": "koala_29", "prompt": "How to improve instance segmentation AP metrics with human knowledge", "answer": "Object detection models and instance segmentation models are often trained with bounding boxes as inputs. Recent advances in object detection and instance segmentation models have dramatically improved the accuracy and AP metrics using bounding boxes as inputs. However, in many use cases, bounding box predictions are difficult or infeasible to obtain, and only the location information of objects/instances of interest are available.\n\nOne way to handle this problem is to use RoI (Region of Interest) for the prediction. The RoI is a subset of the original image that contains the object of interest. And instance segmentation models can be fine-tuned to predict the segmentation mask of the region of interest. However, RoI based approaches often lead to dramatic drops in AP metrics, since the model is trained to predict object/instance location using bounding boxes and not the location information from the image.\n\nOne way to improve the AP metrics with RoI is to incorporate human knowledge into the training process. If we provide the human with bounding box and mask coordinates, then the human can help the model to learn the correlation between bounding box and mask location. One way to achieve this is to add a human annotator to the automatic annotation process. The automatic annotation will provide a bounding box and the mask location, and the human annotator needs to help the automatic annotation system to find the human-annotated mask location that is close to the bounding box location. In this way, we can provide the model with the correlation between bounding box and mask location."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": ".... (C.. in and and.

He argues that the efficient market hypothesis is the main reason why people lose money in the stock market. He says that market prices are not the rational reflection of information. Instead, they fluctuate around a random walk, and therefore, there is no way to beat the market. In other words, he argues against the efficient-market hypothesis, saying that it is impossible to beat the market. Taleb argues that markets are more like a casino than a science. He says that there is nothing rational about market prices. Taleb also argues that people who believe in the efficient-market hypothesis are like religious people. He says that they believe in things for which there is no evidence and they are dogmatic about their beliefs."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "  and  theums and \n  [ ical ays  theges  thegsphere-gificify andquisify  soversphereflify ical  thexify  the \nthequire  the few \nW \nCivifies \n\n\nAganical  \n\n \n\n1C             1  1 1  111.  1   plan,     G      [multiple   complementary        background      (    [  code-extracting code"}

{"id": "koala_52", "prompt": "Over two thousand years, the moon has covered every point on the Earth once. At the most recent time of a moonrise, the moon is going to cover the next point to the north. How far north will it be?", "answer": "The moonrise will occur at the horizon, and the horizon is a great circle on the Earth's surface. The north pole of the Earth is on a line through the center of the Earth to the opposite side of the Earth, which is the south pole. North of the north pole is an imaginary sphere, the polar sphere, which passes through the north pole and touches the Earth at the surface. At the instant of the moonrise, the moon will cover the point on the polar sphere that is north of the point the moon is over. The distance from the north pole to the point the moon is over is the radius of the polar sphere. The distance from the north pole to the point the moon covers is the same as the distance from the north pole to the point the moon is over, which is the radius of the polar sphere. Therefore, the moon will be covering the point that is north of the point the moon is over by the same distance as the north pole is to the point the moon is over."}

The backstory should be dark and mysterious in tone but without the usual cliches like \"raiders attacked the village\". Make it unique and interesting. Be creative.", "answer": "My character, Ner'ru, was born and raised in the city of Korvosa. He was the son of a wealthy merchant who lived a comfortable life. He grew up surrounded by family, friends, and luxury. However, he was always drawn to nature and the outdoors. He found himself spending as much time as he could away from the city, exploring the forests that surrounded the city.\n\nOne day, while exploring the forest, Ner'ru came across a tribe of goblins who were apparently raiding a traveling caravan. He watched from the shadows as the goblins viciously attacked the travelers and ransacked the caravan. He watched in horror as the goblins murdered the travelers and took their belongings.\n\nNer'ru knew he had to do something. He drew his bow and nocked an arrow. He took aim at the leader of the goblin tribe. He knew if he killed the goblin leader, the rest of the goblins would flee.\n\nAs Ner'ru drew back his bow, he was shocked to see the leader of the goblins was not a goblin at all, but a half-elf! The half-elf was not a member of the goblin tribe. He was just as shocked to see a member of his own race so viciously attacking another.\n\nNer'ru lowered his bow. He watched as the half-elf was surrounded and attacked by the rest of the goblin tribe. Ner'ru felt sick to his stomach as the half-elf was overpowered and brutally murdered.\n\nNer'ru was shaken by what he had witnessed. He knew he had to leave the forest and never return. He returned to the city and never spoke of what he had seen.\n\nSeveral months later, Ner'ru's father was killed in an apparent goblin raid. The family lost everything they owned. Ner'ru was forced to leave the comfort and security of his home and begin living on the streets.\n\nNer'ru spent the next several years living in the streets of Korvosa. He survived by stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. He developed a reputation as a Robin Hood-like figure among the poor and destitute of the city.\n\nOne day, while robbing a wealthy merchant's home, Ner'ru was caught by the owner of the house. Ner'ru was brought before the magistrate of the city. He was sentenced to death for his crimes.\n\nAs Ner'ru was being lead to the gallows, the magistrate had a change of heart and pardoned him. The magistrate offered Ner'ru a choice. He could either go to prison for the rest of his life or he could join the Korvosa City Watch and fight crime as a ranger. Ner'ru accepted the offer and joined the City Watch.\n\nNer'ru has been a member of the City Watch for over 10 years. He has fought countless battles against goblins, orcs, and other monsters. He has earned a reputation as a skilled ranger and a fearless warrior.\n\nNer'ru has always wondered what happened to the half-elf he saw in the forest that fateful day. He has always wondered if he was responsible for the half-elf's death. He has never spoken of what he saw to anyone. He knows if he does, he will be branded as a lunatic.\n\nNer'ru has no regrets. He is at peace with his life and his past. He knows he has made a difference in the world. He knows he has lived a full and meaningful life."}

Growing up in the 80's, my parents would take my sister and I to museums when they could.  The first one I remember going to was the Art Institute of Chicago.  The first gallery we went to was the Impressionist gallery.  I was completely mesmerized by the paintings.  I could stare at them for hours and never get bored.  I still have a vivid memory of staring at this one painting of a woman sitting at a table surrounded by flowers.  The rich colors and detail was just amazing to me.  The artist, Vincent van Gogh, was also an inspiration to me.  I loved his use of color and his painting style.  His work never failed to move me.\n\nIn high school I took a photography class and discovered darkroom photography.  I fell in love with the process of developing the film and then printing the photos.  The magic of seeing a negative turn into a positive was like a miracle to me.  I was hooked.  I continued to take classes and eventually became the photo editor for our school's newspaper and yearbook.  My interest in photography continued in college when I took more classes and joined the school's photography club.  My inspiration now came from both contemporary and historical photographers.  Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, and Harry Callahan were some of my favorites.  I was also fascinated by the work of artists like Georgia O'Keefe, Edward Hopper, and Andrew Wyeth.  Their use of color and composition inspired me.\n\nI continued to be inspired by photographers throughout my career in the corporate world.  The work of artists like Robert Frank, Joel Sternfeld, and Lee Friedlander had a profound influence on me.  Their ability to capture the mood and feel of a place and time was remarkable.  Their work continues to inspire me today.  I am now in the process of exploring fine art photography myself.  My inspiration now comes from both historical and contemporary photographers.  Documentary photographers like Jacob Riis, Dorothea Lange, and Walker Evans continue to inspire me.  Their ability to tell a story through their photographs is remarkable.  Contemporary artists like Sally Mann, Joel Sternfeld, and Thomas Struth are also a source of inspiration to me.  Their use of both color and black and white, as well as their composition, continues to amaze me.\n\nPhotography and art in general continues to inspire me.  The ability of the artist to share their vision with the world is both humbling and inspiring to me.  The work of each artist tells a piece of their story and allows me to share in that experience.  I continue to be inspired by the work of both historic and contemporary photographers.  Their talent, vision, and commitment to their craft is unmatched."}

The car driver has to pay for the fuel and has to also pay for the congestion charge for driving in central London. The driver needs to allow for extra time to drive in the heavy traffic and so needs to factor in extra time during their journey.\n\nLet's look at the fuel costs first. The cost of fuel for a 14 mile journey in a car with 48mpg is 625p per gallon. There are 0.00625 gallons in a pint and 4.546095 pints in a gallon so the cost of fuel for a pint is 3.59p. The driver needs to pay for the fuel and the congestion charge, which is £11.50 per day so the total cost of the fuel and the congestion charge is £11.50 + 3.59p = £11.99.\n\nLet's look at the congestion charge now. The driver needs to pay for the fuel and the congestion charge, which is £11.50 per day so the total cost of the fuel and the congestion charge is £11.50 + 3.59p = £11.99.\n\nThe total cost of the fuel is £11.99.\n\nLet's now look at the time factor. The driver needs to allow extra time to drive in the heavy traffic and so needs to factor in extra time during their journey. The journey is 14 miles so the driving time at 48 mpg is 1.7 hours. There is also the time to pay for the fuel and the congestion charge which adds another 0.75 hours to the total driving time. The total driving time is 2.45 hours.\n\nThe driver needs to add extra time for the heavy traffic, which is half the journey, which is 7.5 miles. They can use the following formula to calculate how long they need to add to their total driving time:\n\nTotal driving time + (7.5/14) x Total driving time\n\n= 2.45 + (7.5/14) x 2.45\n= 2.45 + 0.575 x 2.45\n= 2.45 + 0.2925 x 2.45\n= 2.45 + 0.72875 x 2.45\n= 2.45 + 0.9875 x 2.45\n= 2.45 + 2.45 x 0.9875\n= 2.45 + 2.45 x 2.45 x 0.9875\n= 2.45 + 2.45 x 6.95\n= 2.45 + 16.925\n= 19.375\n\nThe extra time for the heavy traffic is 1.375 hours so the total driving time is 3.825 hours.\n\nThe total cost of the fuel and the congestion charge is £11.99\n\nThe total driving time is 3.825 hours\n\nThe total cost of the fuel and the congestion charge plus the extra time for the heavy traffic is £11.99 + 3.825 + 1.375 = £16.19"}

{"id": "koala_84", "prompt": "Title: \"Inspiration, Infallibility, and Inerrancy: Hath God Said? with R.C. Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth.

{"id": "koala_86", "prompt": "when are hops added to the brewing process?", "answer": "hops are typically added to the brewing process in one of two ways. The first way is to add them at the beginning of the boil. This is known as the \"single-infusion\" method and is the most traditional way of brewing beer. The second way is called \"hop-backing\" and involves adding the hops later in the brewing process. In this method, the beer is boiled for the normal duration, then cooled down. The hops are then added back to the now-cooled wort. This method is often used to increase the amount of bittering hops in the beer."}

Use descriptive language.  Include personal anecdotes.  These sources will be listed in a Works Cited at the end of the essay. Use a four in-text citations in MLA style in the body of the essay.  ", "answer": "As a first-year college student at Northern Arizona University, I have lived in two unique locations over the past two years.  The first was Flagstaff, Arizona, a quaint mountain town with a population of about 70,000 people.  The second was Kaneohe, Hawaii, a suburban town on the island of Oahu with a population of about 35,000 people.  These two very different locations provided me with a unique perspective on some universal truths about the human condition.\n\nOne of the most striking similarities between the two places is the strength of the community.  People in both locations take great pride in their town and spend a lot of time and energy supporting local businesses.  In Flagstaff, the first Saturday of the month is “Local First” Saturday, where people shop only at locally owned businesses.  In Kaneohe, the first Friday of the month is “Aloha Friday”, where people relax and enjoy each other’s company instead of going to their normal weekly happy hour.  In both places, people look out for each other and are generally welcoming to newcomers.\n\nAnother similarity is that both places are blessed with stunning natural beauty.  Flagstaff is located in the high desert and is surrounded by massive mountains on all sides.  The San Francisco Peaks, which are the highest mountains in Arizona, rise up directly behind the NAU campus.  Kaneohe is located on the windward side of Oahu, which means that it experiences frequent trade winds that keep the temperatures tolerable (even during the summer).  The Pacific Ocean is also a short walk away, and many residents enjoy going to the beach for a swim or to watch the sunrise or sunset.\n\nThese two very different places have also taught me some universal truths about the human condition.  It is important to surround yourself with supportive and like-minded people, and this is especially true when you are far away from your family and friends.  It is important to be kind to others, because you never know when you might need help from someone else.  And finally, it is important to appreciate the beauty that is all around us, because it is easy to take it for granted."}

Let's assume you are a client and we are in our first session. You have come to me for help managing your emotions. First, let me begin by saying I am happy you have come to me and I look forward to working with you. Now that we have gotten the formalities out of the way, let's get started.\n\nThere are several things we can work on, but I think the most pressing issue for you is managing your emotions. As you know, emotions are neither good nor bad, however, reacting to them in a way that is not helpful to you or others is what we want to work on. To do this, we will use a pause ritual. The pause ritual is a simple technique where you take three deep breaths and pause for three seconds after each breath. This will help you stay in the present moment and not get lost in the past or future, where your emotions will take you.\n\nI want you to try this now with me. Take a deep breath in for three seconds. Hold that breath for three seconds. Now exhale for three seconds. Hold that breath out for three seconds, and then exhale normally. Do you feel more settled? \n\nThis is the first step in managing your emotions. You can use this pause ritual before reacting to a situation. The next step is to observe your emotions as they arise. You might find it helpful to label your emotions. For example, you might say to yourself, \"I am feeling anxious.\" This will help you understand what is happening inside of you. This will also help you realize that your emotions are fleeting and not who you are. You are not anxious, you are feeling anxious.\n\nThese are just a few tips to help you manage your emotions. Remember, you are not your emotions and they are not who you are. You are the observer. Stay present and use the pause ritual to help you manage your emotions."}

The weight automatically relaxes your nervous system, reducing cortisol (stress hormone) while increasing serotonin (happy hormone) and melatonin (sleepy hormone). So you get to sleep faster, sleep more deeply, and wake up refreshed.\n\n2. Relax & De-Stress\nIf stress or anxiety is keeping you up, a weighted blanket can help. Originally invented to help people with attention or sensory disorders calm their mind and fall asleep, they calm your heart rate and breathing. Combined with the serotonin and melatonin they help release, they help reduce racing thoughts and worries.\n\n3. Quality Materials\nWe believe in quality products that last. Instead of the large plastic pellets many of our competitors use for weight, we use fine, non-toxic glass microbeads that distribute evenly and comfortably over your body. These weighted inserts are easy to remove for washing, and our covers are soft and durable.\n\n4. For Hot or Cold Sleepers\nNo matter what your preference, we’ve got you. If you’re a hot sleeper, our Hush Iced 2.0 is actively cooling; if you’re a cold sleeper, our Classic Blanket is soft and cozy. And if you want the ability to swap, our 2-in-1 Blanket bundles both for the best of both worlds!\n\n5. Free Shipping & Money-Back Guarantee\nWe provide free shipping Canada-wide, and a 100-Night Money-Back Guarantee on all our blankets. You can try your blanket for a full 100 nights, and if you’re not satisfied, return it for a full refund!\n\n100 NIGHT FREE TRIAL\nComes in all sizes\n\nSHOP NOW\nHUSH ICED 2.0\nCooling Weighted Blanket For Night Sweats, Anxiety & Stress\n\nFROM $239\n\nSHOP NOW\nTHE HUSH CLASSIC\nBlanket with duvet cover for Stress-reducing and sleep-initiating\n\nFROM $269\n\nSHOP NOW\nHUSH THROW\nWeighted Throw for immediate stress relief after work\n\nFROM $259"}
{"id": "koala_106", "prompt": "In order to launch a token for a Defi project, I want to sell some tokens privately to early investors and then add it to a launchpad. let me know what can I do with my smart contract? Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract?", "answer": "You can expose an interface in your smart contract that allows investors to submit their ETH address and the number of tokens they want to purchase. You can also set a minimum and maximum number of tokens they can buy. After the investors submit their information, you can store their ETH address and the amount of tokens they want to purchase in a database. After the end of the token sale, you can use the information in the database to send the ETH to the investors and distribute the tokens to the addresses they specified.\n\nYou shouldn't create a separate presale contract because the presale and the main sale are essentially the same. The only difference is that you can lower the price for the presale."}

Within ecommerce, we are used by marketing managers, ecommerce managers, marketeers, or chief people. \n\nTogether with another company, Accurat.ai we are trying to get the MIT AI Grant. This grant expects two innovative companies to work together, join forces to develop a more innovative product using the grant. \n\nDescription Accurat.ai\n''Accurat is a location intelligence startup, providing actionable insights to retail brands including Ahold group, Lidl and Aldi as well as for media companies such as Clear Channel.\n\nWe believe good decision making is based on solid and complete data. Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

{"id": "koala_122", "prompt": "The sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometres. Write a formula that finds the distance between the sun and Earth. How many years will the eclipse last?", "answer": "The distance the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometres.

Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "I think there is a deep resonance between aikido and Krishnamurti's teaching. I think the main points in his teaching are the exploration of the \"field of consciousness\" which is the state of being present, aware of what is happening in the here and now. This is the state of non-judgment, non-violence, non-duality and non-action that can be found in aikido. The way of teaching is to lead, not to instruct, to let the student explore on their own, to discover for themselves, not to give them ready-made answers. \n\nI believe it would be possible to apply these principles to teaching aikido.

{"id": "koala_127", "prompt": "write a detailed business plan for fatherhood training based on Dwayne Meeks book Pieces never missing in a childs life", "answer": "An effective fatherhood program should:\n1) Be father-involved\n2) Address the needs of each participant by providing supportive services\n3) Be culturally relevant and non-judgmental\n4) Be consistent and reliable\n5) Be trauma-informed\n6) Promote self-sufficiency and accountability\n7) Be flexible and responsive\n8) Be community-based\n\nA fatherhood program should be father-involved, meaning that men are actively engaged in the design, implementation, and delivery of the program. When participants are engaged in the design and implementation of the program, they are more likely to engage in the program and to see the program as relevant to their needs. Additionally, actively engaging men as program facilitators and leaders normalizes men as caregivers, which can challenge the stigma and social norms that limit men’s engagement in caregiving roles. Men who may have had negative experiences with father figures can gain a sense of empowerment and healing by serving as mentors and role models to other fathers.\n\nA fatherhood program should address the needs of each participant by providing supportive services. All participants should have access to the services they need to be successful, regardless of their stage in the program. These services may include:\n1) Basic needs assistance, such as housing, food, and child care\n2) Financial coaching and budgeting assistance\n3) Health and wellness services, such as mental health services, healthy lifestyle coaching, and substance use disorder recovery support\n4) Education and workforce development services, such as GED and vocational training, job readiness training, and career counseling\n5) Legal assistance and representation\n6) Fatherhood education and support groups\n7) Transportation assistance\n8) Child care, including parenting classes, parent-child interaction groups, and specialized services for children with disabilities\n9) Re-entry support for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated fathers\n10) Reunification services for separated fathers and their children\n11) Adoption support\n12) Intergenerational activities, such as mentoring and tutoring, that bridge the generational gap between fathers and their children\n13) Community building activities that promote a sense of connection and belonging\n\nA fatherhood program should be culturally relevant and non-judgmental. To be effective, a program should be tailored to the participants’ unique needs and circumstances. For example, a program for incarcerated fathers should include services that address their unique needs, such as re-entry planning and preparing for the return home. A program for fathers in the military should include services that recognize their unique situation, such as transition assistance for fathers returning from deployment. In addition to providing culturally relevant services, the program should be non-judgmental and respectful of participants’ experiences, history, and decisions. This can be challenging in fatherhood programs, as participants may have engaged in harmful or abusive behaviors that have had a negative impact on their children. However, a non-judgmental approach that emphasizes unconditional positive regard can help participants feel supported and accepted.\n\nA fatherhood program should be consistent and reliable. Participants should be able to rely on the program to provide the services they need when they need them, regardless of funding or staffing changes. This can be challenging in programs that are dependent on government funding, as funding opportunities often come and go. In this case, it is important to advocate for stable funding and to develop a diverse funding base that includes government, corporate, and philanthropic sources.\n\nA fatherhood program should be trauma-informed. Many of the men who participate in fatherhood programs have experienced trauma, such as abuse, violence, or the loss of a loved one. Trauma can have a significant impact on a person’s mental and physical health, as well as their relationships with others. A trauma-informed approach recognizes the impact of trauma on participants’ lives and seeks to address the underlying causes of their struggles, rather than their symptoms. This approach fosters a sense of safety and empowerment, which can help participants heal from past trauma and build stronger relationships with their children and other loved ones.\n\nA fatherhood program should promote self-sufficiency and accountability.

It is important to document the past in a way that is both accurate and accessible to the widest audience.  \n\nArchaeologists and historians work together to document sites of historical interest, while also trying to understand the past through material culture.  The use of science and technology to both excavate and preserve sites is critical, as is the ability to communicate the importance of the sites to the public. \n\nUnderstanding the past allows us to better understand the present, and gives us a context for the future.  Historical sites help us to understand the context of current events and can help us to better predict how future events might unfold."}

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

It is known for its pristine natural beauty and stunning views. The only inhabitants are a small group of fisherman that live off the land and the sea, working only during the summer months.\n\nThe fisherman live in a small village at the southern tip of the island. They live simple lives, eating what they catch or grow themselves. Their homes are simple huts made from driftwood and twigs, and they live with their families and friends in close quarters.\n\nThere is a sinister force that drives the inhabitants insane. The fisherman find themselves unable to control their actions, and begin to harm one another. They turn on their friends and family, and slowly descend into madness.\n\nThose that are not driven to violence find themselves unable to speak, and are unable to communicate their distress. They become mute, and are driven from their families.\n\nThe villagers begin to fear and distrust one another. Paranoia and suspicion are rampant, and soon the island is consumed by madness and violence.\n\nFinally, only a few remain, and they too realize they can not control their actions. They must fight or be killed. The last man standing is a young boy, who has watched as his friends and family were driven to violence. He realizes what is happening is not natural, and that there is some outside force driving the inhabitants insane.\n\nThe boy realizes what is happening, and uses an old fishing net to create a makeshift noose. He finds a large boulder in the sand, and uses it to hang himself.\n\nHe is found the next morning by a passing boat, and his body is taken to the mainland. The fisherman of the mainland believe he has been driven mad by the island, and that his death was a suicide.\n\nThey bury him, and return to their lives.

It should be noted that the energy efficiency of a window is dependent on many factors such as the type and number of panes of glass and the type of gas used in the space between the panes of glass.  A single pane window can be more efficient than a double pane window if the window is coated on the inside with a special energy efficient coating that reduces the amount of heat that passes through the window.

He made this argument in his famous \"Who is a Jew\" speech where he stated that, \"Anyone who is not in basic opposition to the establishment of a Jewish state in any part of the land of Israel is a good Arab but is not a good Jew.\" \n\nAbraham Fanon, a prominent Algerian Jewish philosopher, wrote extensively on the psychological effects of the Algerian War of Independence where over 1 million Algerians were killed by the French. Fanon believed that the violence that was inflicted on the Algerians by the French was so traumatizing that \"colonialism causes pathologies\" that could never be healed. Fanon believed that the only way for Algeria to heal from this trauma was to physically remove the French from the country, and this would only be possible with violence. \n\nSlavoj Zizek is another well-known Slovenian philosopher, who in his book Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism, discusses the use of violence in Hegel's philosophy. Zizek argues that although Hegel believed that only through the use of reason can one achieve truth, Hegel also believed that there was a darker, more primitive side of our human nature that only through violence can we achieve truth. This darker, more violent side of our human nature is what Zizek calls the \"Lacanian Real\". Violence is therefore a necessity for us to move from the \"Virtual\" to the \"Real\"."}

This has impacted the way of life, traditions, and customs of each group. For example, the African American culture has a much stronger connection to their ancestors and heritage. They have a rich oral tradition that has been passed down through the generations. This is because the history of oppression has led to a lack of documentation of their history. In contrast, the African culture has a much more casual relationship with their ancestors. They celebrate their heritage through music and dance, but do not have as strong a connection to their ancestors as the African American culture."}
{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a statically typed programming language from Microsoft that targets the .NET ecosystem. The language is compiled to plain old .NET (PONTY) assemblies, which can be consumed by any .NET language or framework.\n\nDuck Typing is a software design approach that allows for dynamic dispatch based on some subset of an object’s type, rather than its declared type. Although Duck Typing is closely related to dynamic typing, the two concepts are distinct. In Duck Typing, the compiler will not check that operations on an object are consistent with the object’s type. In contrast, dynamic typing does not allow for dynamic dispatch, and prevents an operation from being performed on an object unless it is consistent with the object’s type.\n\nThe name Duck Typing comes from the idea that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck. In other words, if an object exhibits the properties and behaviors of a specific type, then it is that type.\n\nSoftware design patterns can be categorized as either structural or behavioral. Structural design patterns describe how components interact, while behavioral design patterns describe how objects and classes interact.\n\nBehavioral design patterns are often implemented using Duck Typing. For example, the strategy pattern is often implemented using Duck Typing, by using a common interface that provides a set of operations, and then binding objects of that type to different implementations at runtime.\n\nThe visitor pattern is another example of a behavioral design pattern that is often implemented using Duck Typing. In this pattern, an object that wishes to process another object creates an interface that defines the operations to be performed on the other object. It then binds a different implementation to the interface for each type of object it wishes to process.\n\nAlthough Duck Typing is closely related to dynamic typing, the two concepts are distinct.

The district's area is mostly rural, and has a lower-than-average percentage of college graduates and higher-than-average unemployment. The district receives over $200,000 a year in state and federal funds for each student. Visalia Unified School District is governed by a five-member board of trustees elected at-large to staggered four-year terms. Board members appoint a superintendent to oversee the district's daily operations. The superintendent and other senior administrators report directly to the board. Each school has a principal and vice-principal who report to the principal of that school's feeder pattern."}
{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "carbon fibers are used in buildings for strengthening  concrete and steel, as well as for thermal insulation.  Carbon fibers are extremely strong, but also relatively light, and can be woven into a fabric that is strong and robust, yet light enough to allow for less concrete or steel to be used, thus lowering the weight of the structure and also lowering costs.  Carbon fibers can also be used as a form of thermal insulation, by adding the fibers to concrete or steel to add insulating properties.  Carbon fibers are also used in some types of fire suppression systems."}

It threatens the well-being of the planet, human societies and all forms of life. \n\nThe scientific consensus is that human activities are the primary cause of climate change. The evidence is overwhelming and the solutions lie in changing how we generate energy and power our societies. We need to move away from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency. We need to stop deforestation and protect the remaining forests. We need to take urgent action to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe Paris Agreement, which was unanimously ratified by all nations except for the United States, is a good first step. However, it's not enough. We need to go further and faster. We need to raise ambition every five years. We need to stop building new coal power plants and phase out existing ones as quickly as possible. We need to stop drilling for oil and gas, and leave most fossil fuels in the ground. We need to stop deforestation and increase forest cover. We need to invest in public transport and sustainable agriculture. We need to innovate and create a clean energy revolution.\n\nThe good news is that all of these measures will also improve our quality of life, create millions of jobs and make our societies more sustainable, equitable and livable.\n\nThe clock is ticking and time is running out. We have the knowledge and the technological solutions to stop climate change and build a sustainable future. What we need is the political will to act now.\n\nThe future of humanity and the planet is in our hands. Let's seize this opportunity and rise to the challenge."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "This is because when you watch a TV episode, you are watching a smaller segment of the story. When you watch a film, you are watching the entire story without any interruption. Since a TV episode is shorter, you can retain more of the details compared to a film. This means less effort is required for you to recall the details of what happened in the TV episode. Since you are retaining more of the details, you are able to enjoy the TV episode more."}

Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, in March 2018. While it is true that Putin had the Skripals killed, this was not an isolated incident, but rather a well thought out and planned campaign of assassination designed to send a message to other government officials and defectors who might consider working with western intelligence agencies. Putin specifically targeted Skripal due to his status as a double agent who sold Russian state secrets to British intelligence. While most assassinations are carried out by direct action agents on foreign soil, this one was thoughtfully planned to include a binary nerve agent that would cause maximum suffering for both the target and their family, while also drawing international attention to the assassination. The defendant, Putin, was aware that the attack would cause widespread outrage and lead to extensive international investigations that would implicate Russia."}
{"id": "koala_166", "prompt": "Explain sarcoidosis to me like I’m a five year old", "answer": "Sarcoidosis is a disease that causes small, round bumps to form in different parts of the body.  It can affect different organs, like the lungs, skin, or liver, and in some cases may grow into larger lumps of tissue called granulomas.  \n\nSarcoidosis can be difficult to diagnose because the bumps of tissue can look like other conditions, and there is no definitive test to prove that a person has the disease.  It is most common in young African-American or Caucasian women, and is often found in people between the ages of 20 and 40.  \n\nWhile sarcoidosis can be bothersome or even painful, it is not contagious and rarely dangerous.  There is no cure, but in most cases the bumps will go away on their own, often within a few years.  There are ways to treat the symptoms, and in some cases the disease may even go into remission."}

For something to be considered rational it has to be based in reality and have some sort of proof to support it.  Objective evidence supports the idea that something actually happened, it is provable through facts, data, or measurable results.  Subjective evidence is based on personal opinions and experiences.

We want to calculate how many months it takes him to do so, and how much money he will have left over after buying the car.\n\nSo he saves `1000*0.5` every month. However, the decrease in value of the cars is a monthly decrease of 1.5 percent. So the value of the old car decreases by `0.015*x` in a month and the value of the secondhand car decreases by `0.015*y` in a month. So the man ends up with `1000*(0.015*x+0.015*y)` after `t` months, and the old car is worth `x-0.015*x*t` and the secondhand car is worth `y-0.015*y*t`. So he ends up with enough money to buy the secondhand car and has a remainder of `1000*(0.015*x-0.015*x*t+0.015*y-0.015*y*t)` which is `0.015*x*t*(x-y)+0.015*y*t*(x-y)`. So he ends up with `1000*0.015*t*(x-y)^2+0.015*t*(x-y)^2` left over. So it takes him `t=6` months and he ends up with `1000*0.015*6*(x-y)^2+0.015*6*(x-y)^2` left over after buying the car. So it takes him `6` months to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, and he ends up with `1000*0.015*6*(x-y)^2+0.015*6*(x-y)^2` left over after buying the car."}

There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " (N [d (C (of [((c of (((h (([S ((((p [d [b in [[–([((d [ar (( [ ( of of of of of, of of of of of of of of of, of (of ([N (th (c, ((C (c (c (c of of of of of (a of of [(e ([m (m of (c of (b of of [t of [(a of ((s of ((h ((s (c it ((b (f of (of of of of of of of (c (?
