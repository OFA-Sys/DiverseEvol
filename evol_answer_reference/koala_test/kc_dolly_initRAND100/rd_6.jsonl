{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Bank uses cash as a buffer to protect against unexpected losses. If a bank uses all of its cash to lend out, it will not have enough cash to cover a sudden surge in loan defaults. Cash is a bank's most liquid asset as it can be easily converted into a usable form such as cash or government bonds. Theoretically speaking, bank do not need to hold any cash if it has adequate capital to cover potential losses. However, in practice, banks hold more cash than the regulatory capital because cash is a quick and easy source of funds to meet liquidity needs."}

", "answer": "Gandalf the Grey was an old and powerful wizard from the North of Middle Earth.  He was known for his wisdom, power, and use of the magic staff.  One of his close friends was a powerful eagle named, \"Nashu\".  Gandalf and Nashu had worked together for many years to keep the lands of Middle Earth safe from evil.  One day, while Gandalf was riding on Nashu's back, they were attacked by a band of orcs.  In the ensuing battle, Gandalf was separated from Nashu and cast down to the Earth.  He landed hard on his head and was knocked unconscious.  \n\nGandalf awoke some time later in a strange place.  He was laying on a bed of soft grass and the sun was shining down on him.  He tried to stand up, but his legs felt weak and wobbly.  Gandalf looked around and saw that he was in a garden surrounded by beautiful flowers.  Gandalf could hear the laughter of children playing in the garden.  He was startled when he saw a large bee land on his nose and start to sting him.  Gandalf tried to swat at the bee, but his arms felt very heavy.  Gandalf looked down and saw a large green worm crawling up his leg.  Gandalf panicked and started screaming.  His screams attracted the attention of the children in the garden.  All of the children started laughing at Gandalf and pointed at him.  Gandalf saw one of the children pick up a large stick and start to approach him.  Gandalf tried to get up, but his legs gave way again and he fell to the ground.  Gandalf lay on the ground and just watched as the children circled around him.  They were all laughing at him and making fun of him.  Gandalf slowly put his hand to his head.  He felt a large bump forming on his forehead.  Gandalf realized that he must have hit his head when he fell from Nashu's back.  Gandalf also saw that his staff was laying next to him.  Gandalf decided to try and pick up his staff.  His hand felt heavy and weak, but Gandalf managed to grasp his staff.  He lifted the staff up and saw that it was broken in half.  Gandalf was sad and started to cry.  Gandalf heard a familiar voice calling his name.  Gandalf turned and saw a man dressed in green robes, \"The Warrior of Light\", standing over him.  The Warrior of Light smiled at Gandalf and said, \"Gandalf, my old friend.  I am so happy to see you awake\".  Gandalf looked up and said, \"Warrior of Light, I have missed you so much\".  The Warrior of Light knelt down next to Gandalf and said, \"Gandalf, I have been searching for you.  I knew you would need my help to recover from your injuries\".  Gandalf looked up at The Warrior of Light and said, \"Warrior of Light, you have been my friend for many years.  You have always been so kind and helpful.  You have no idea how much I have missed you\".  The Warrior of Light smiled and said, \"Gandalf, I have been thinking of you during your time of recovery.  I have been praying that you would find your way back to me.  I am so happy to see you awake\".  Gandalf looked up at The Warrior of Light again and said, \"Warrior of Light, I have no idea what happened to me.  I remember riding on Nashu's back, but then all went black.  When I awoke, I was in this strange garden and there were children pointing at me and laughing.  I tried to stand up, but my legs would not hold me.  I was so scared that I started to cry.  I heard a familiar voice calling my name.  I turned and saw you standing over me.  I was so happy to see you.  Warrior of Light, where am I?  And most importantly, how did I get here?\"  The Warrior of Light stood up and said, \"Gandalf, my old friend.  I am so happy that you have awoken.  You have been asleep for many days.

Once the composite choreographic business solution is modeled using friendly graphical interfaces, the model becomes the live operational solution, without needing additional programming and without costly XML modifications to existing applications. By avoiding programming costs in the composite layer and eliminating the need for XML programming changes to all other systems, n-MDA materializes the \"Agile Enterprise\" benefits of SOA and BPM without the major expense, time and risk of heavily programmed, intrusive deployments. Extensive discussions with other system owners about XML formats and standards are avoided because Instaknow-ACE can do real-time interactions with any other application without XML, using patented \"non-intrusive interaction\" technology advances. Instaknow's \"No Change to Existing Systems\" process automation approach results in avoidance of huge amount of technical analysis, design, coding, testing efforts and costs, freeing up technology staff and budgets to deliver other new, strategically valuable business systems.

This is because digestion of carbohydrates requires the body to break the macronutrient down into its constituent monosaccharides which are then absorbed and metabolised. The energy required to perform this process is reflected in the 400kCal value of carbohydrates.\n\nNow consider the 100g of protein. 100g of protein contains the same 400kCal of energy as 100g of carbohydrates. However, protein is digested differently to carbohydrates. Protein is broken down into amino acids which are then absorbed and metabolised by the body. The energy required to perform this process is reflected in the 400kCal value of proteins.\n\nFinally, consider 100g of fat. Fat contains 900kCal of energy.

Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness.

Its goal is to prevent drowning and injury of children in and around water. WSE is based on the concept that when adequate barriers, such as walls or fences, are combined with appropriate supervision, drowning and resulting injury can be significantly reduced in children under five years of age.\n\nIn 2009, WHO and UNICEF launched the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020, with the aim of stabilizing and then reducing the incidence of road traffic deaths and injuries. An international collaborative effort led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF is now implementing a WSE strategy to reduce drowning and related injuries in children.

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": ".. and in. in... and and and my, am d my and and and in and in and \"st and and ([at. and out, am (per in of non [in \"c at an, to in or to h to to to to to to and and a and of of of of of of of of of of. and and and and-d and in and and of are and of (h of of of of of of and of (h and. and.. and (h.

An ideological way of thinking is a mode of thinking and a set of beliefs that are driven by an ideology (a set of ideas that shape and inform a person's view of society and the world), and that are not critically examined. So, for example, someone who holds an ideology of capitalism might believe that economic competition is beneficial to society and that governments should therefore not interfere in economic markets. They might also believe that the role of government is to protect the rights of citizens and that governments should therefore regulate the economy to protect the rights of workers. While holding these two beliefs might seem inconsistent to someone who does not accept the ideology of capitalism, for the person who holds both beliefs, the beliefs are not inconsistent because their ideological beliefs influence their interpretation of the facts."}

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems.

Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more.

The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager!

Du Bois was a notable African-American sociologist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, and author who, early in his career, became one of the co-founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\nDu Bois was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, to a newly free slave woman, Mary Silvina (née Dungee), and her second husband, a white yeoman farmer and carpenter, Alfred Du Bois. When Du Bois was a child, his father's refusal to accept the local custom that black families sit in the balcony at local theaters, on pain of death, led to his death. Du Bois grew up in a culturally liberal household. He attended public school and acquired a love of literature and history. In 1885, he earned a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst).\n\nIn 1890, Du Bois graduated from college with a bachelor's degree and went on to study at Harvard University. He earned his doctorate in 1895, becoming the first African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard. While at Harvard, Du Bois studied with William James and took a particular interest in psychology.\n\nDu Bois's career as a sociologist of race began with his study of the social and economic conditions of black Atlanta residents in 1897. In 1898, he published The Philadelphia Negro, which is considered to be the first major sociological study of an urban black community.\n\nIn 1897, Du Bois became the first African American elected to the faculty of a predominantly white university, when he joined the faculty of Atlanta University, an historically black college. At Atlanta University, Du Bois taught sociology and worked as a researcher on the Atlanta Compromise Speech, a famous address delivered by Booker T. Washington in 1895.\n\nDu Bois's 1903 book The Souls of Black Folk is a seminal work in African-American literature. In it, Du Bois articulated the veil concept, the idea that black Americans of his time lived with the perception of always being regarded as second-class citizens with the implication that race was the primary and dominant characteristic of their identity. According to Du Bois, African Americans who had achieved success in American society were threatened with the charge of \"acting white\" and being considered an \"Uncle Tom\". Du Bois also coined the phrase \"Talented Tenth\" to refer to a select group of African-Americans with exceptional skills and leadership qualities who would lead their people to equality and full participation in American society.\n\nDu Bois was a major proponent of Pan-Africanism, the ideology that calls for the solidarity of all people of African descent. He attended the Pan-African Conference in London in 1900, an event which marked the beginning of the Pan-African movement. In 1901, Du Bois joined other influential African-Americans, including Ida B. Wells and Mary McLeod Bethune, in founding the Niagara Movement, an organization dedicated to civil rights and African-American equality. The organization was a precursor to the NAACP, which Du Bois helped found in 1909. Du Bois served as the organization's first editor of its magazine, The Crisis, and its chairman of the board of directors.\n\nIn 1910, Du Bois's book The Souls of Black Folk was published. In 1915, he became a prominent member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and served as its vice-president from 1919 to 1923 and as its director of research from 1934 to 1944. Through his position with the NAACP, Du Bois helped to draft and lobby for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also helped to found several influential academic journals, including the Journal of Negro History, which is still published today.\n\nDu Bois also campaigned for international recognition of the rights of black people throughout the world. In 1919, he attended the Paris Peace Conference, where he presented a proposal for the creation of a League of Nations governing committee on the rights of minorities. Du Bo"}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "  programify thatica ulify ical contentical version 1ics 1ica ify theixel template inquisifies ifies twoductive twoifies icescriptivifies the"}

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

{"id": "koala_58", "prompt": "which second messenger molecule acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions", "answer": "The second messenger molecule that acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions is diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG is a lipid molecule that binds to and activates a protein called protein kinase C. Once activated, protein kinase C can phosphorylate proteins and subsequently alter their function. One of the proteins that can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C is a calcium release channel found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Phosphorylation of this protein alters its conformation and allows calcium ions to diffuse into the cytosol."}

He had traveled across many systems and met many different kinds of people, but he had never met a Jedi. He had just about given up hope.\n\nThen one day he found himself in a cantina on a small planet, drinking a glass of wine and listening to the music. A group of aliens in ornate robes were sitting at the table next to him, discussing something in a language that Anakin didn't understand.\n\nAs the music ended, one of the aliens stood up and spoke. \"My friends, I have news of great import,\" he said. \"I have received a message from a Jedi Master named Obi-Wan Kenobi. He has told me of a great danger to the Republic, and has requested my assistance.\"\n\nThe aliens at the table began talking among themselves, and Anakin lost interest. He had spent the last few weeks traveling the galaxy, chasing down rumors of Jedi, and had grown frustrated. He thought about leaving, but then he remembered something one of the aliens had said as they were talking. \"We are the last of the Jedi,\" he had said. \"There are no others.\"\n\nThat stuck in Anakin's mind. He had encountered many Jedi Masters on his quest, but none of them had been able to tell him where to find another Jedi. They had told him stories of the past, but not of the present. And the alien had said that there were no others.\n\nAnakin sat back down at the table. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. I was also a Jedi, many years ago. I fought in the Clone Wars, alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi. Do you know him?\"\n\nThe alien was so startled by the question that he almost fell over. \"Obi-Wan Kenobi!\" he exclaimed. \"Our Order was founded by Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi, who served as a Jedi Knight under the tutelage of a former Jedi named Qui-Gon Jinn. They were both well known and respected members of our Order.\"\n\n\"I was Qui-Gon Jinn's Padawan,\" Anakin said. \"I know Obi-Wan Kenobi.\"\n\n\"You know him?\" the alien asked. \"Then you must help us! Obi-Wan has received a message from a Sith Lord. He believes the Sith are gathering their forces for an attack on the Republic, and he has sent for us to help him.\"\n\n\"A Sith Lord?\" Anakin asked. \"I thought the Jedi were extinct. I thought there was only one left.\"\n\n\"There is,\" the alien said. \"Obi-Wan believes that the Sith have found a way to bring their numbers back, and they are planning to destroy the Republic and enslave the galaxy.\"\n\nAnakin was shocked. \"The Sith? The most evil beings in the galaxy? They're coming back?\"\n\nThe alien smiled. \"But of course! That's what Jedi were trained to do. Obi-Wan has sent for us to help him defend the Republic against the Sith, and we are honored to have a Jedi Knight join our ranks.\""}

You open an account with a brokerage firm (e.g. TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, etc) and fund the account with the amount of money you wish to invest.  You then choose the stock you wish to buy, place a market order, and wait for the order to be filled.  Once the order is filled, you become the owner of that share of stock, and you now have a stake in that business.  A year later, the company decides to pay its shareholders a dividend.  The company announces that it will pay a dividend of $0.50 per share, and that the dividend will be paid on January 1st of the following year.  Let's say you own 100 shares of the company.  You would receive $50 as a dividend payment (100 shares X $0.50 per share), and you would now own 100 shares times $0.50, or $50 worth of stock.  If the company decides to increase its dividend for the following year, you would also receive the higher dividend amount, which would be $0.60 per share."}

{"id": "koala_84", "prompt": "Title: \"Inspiration, Infallibility, and Inerrancy: Hath God Said? with R.C. Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": ", [content, [h, and,, eng, and, and, [cont, and, (cou [[cont [inf of - you (and, [d of a (in of the of our of of of of [information of d and of of (h (d of of of [[s of, of an or (Hou (c (sur ((f (c (sem ((c, (c (c [c [c [p (d (H (d (th (f ([[c and,, and, or, the, [(s, and, and, -subject, a, and, (specific (d, (se, in and, (person, and (of, of, of of, of, and of, and, and, and, and of, of, of of of inf, [[c, (c, (in, and, [inn, and [and, and and (c [inc, and of and of of of of of of of of of [of of of (of of of of, of of the of ia of of [d of, (in, (c of, of of of (sen, (c of [I of (subject (N of of of (cont of (c (c of (f, [S (c [c (h of (In (C [(In (F (In (f (for (C ((c [m of (of of (of of of of of [M of your (W (c [d (S (C, (d, the ([cont,, (C, (c (in, (h (h of specific, w (h ((history and [p, sen (F, to ((h (d, (t (C(the, and (in (([gener our,(for [p of (d (sur of (of, (S (d, [w (h, of ((cer ((to (C (c, (C (s (S (C (C, (F of the (c of (–-of of of of of of of em of of, (C (feature of (g (c (feature of ((cont of (C ((t, ((subject ((dis ((c of of of of of of of of of of of (h of of (d of, and, or, (and, (co (b (cont,–((c (of of them of, of, of, of, (t of in the h. of, of (central of their of the (j of, or, the ((trans (dis (th, (t (co -c? in (b and of (C and and or, and (h (f (of (of of (of of of (of of of of of them of “c of \"h of, and of, and of of of their of a of, of (trans of,, of of in (and, ((dis., (of (of, of, of of, of, of in of of (f of, for, of (of (center of of of the of of of [of over of of, of of (t of, in ((d,,, dis,, (and,, of, (d, in, (over,-t, c, in, and and of, of a of of of of of of of the of of of, of,, of \"(sm and (to,, of, of, of,,,,,, of, (d, of trans, of of, in of, (sa,, (c of, of, of,,,, of, of, of, of, of trans of of of, of of of, of (d, for, (b, (b, (for, as, (( (d (sm of of b of ((c of of of of of of of of of (th of (of (((re of of (B of (–( of ((( of of, the, c (, them, ((C ((C of of of of of (C of of of of of ( of of of of of of, of, of of of of of of of of of of of of of, [, of of of, of of of, of of, of, (( of of, of of of (f of ( of of of of, of of of, of of of of of, of (of t of of of of of of w of of of, of of, of,, of “[ ( of, ( ( of of of, of [of ((of of of of of ( of of of ( of of of of of of, of"}

Financial assets include stocks, bonds, derivatives and currencies. Financial markets can be classified into two main categories: capital markets and money markets. Capital markets are markets for long-term raising of capital, whereas money markets are for short-term borrowing of money. The former are also referred to as equity markets and the latter as debt markets.\n\nThe two most important financial markets in the world are the stock market (also called the equity market) and the bond market. The stock market refers to a collection of stock exchanges around the world where buyers and sellers exchange ownership of stock in publicly traded companies. The bond market refers to the market for lending money to governments, corporations and other entities. Bonds are considered to be loans to these entities and are traded at bond markets.\n\nIn addition to these two markets, there are a number of other markets that facilitate trading in financial assets. The derivatives market is one such market where financial contracts derived from other assets are traded. These contracts are often used for hedging or trading purposes. The foreign exchange market or forex market is another important financial market where currencies are traded."}

This can be controlled by how responsive the physics or other in-game systems are, as well as the audio design of the game. Good game feel can add to the immersion of the player into the experience.\n3. Flow: This refers to the sense of progress and accomplishment the player gets as they play through the game. A good game has a smooth and uninterrupted flow from one challenge or activity to another.\n4. Metagame: This refers to aspects of the game that occur outside the actual gameplay. Examples of this would be the player's interaction with the game's community and economy, as well as their unlocking of achievements. Metagame features can enhance or detract from the player's experience.\n5. Pacing: This refers to how fast or slow the gameplay is.

Are you feeling the sensation in your body? Are you feeling your heart beat? Breathing in that sensation, breathe out and send love to yourself."}

Moon will run as the candidate of the opposition Minjoo Party of Korea. If reelected, he will be the second incumbent South Korean president to serve a full five-year term since the country's transition to a democracy in 1987.\n\nMoon will face a conservative candidate backed by his own party's main rival, the Liberty Korea Party. He will also face an independent candidate supported by the opposition Bareun Party. In the 2017 election, Moon defeated then-President Park Geun-hye's conservative candidate, the former Governor of South Chungcheong Province Hong Joon-pyo, by a wide margin. Moon's approval ratings peaked at 88% immediately after his inauguration, but have since declined, in part due to his administration's perceived failure to address high youth unemployment. Moon is the first South Korean president to have earned a doctorate degree, and is often described as an \"outsider\" who has not benefited from the \"old Boy's network\"."}

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

How many years will the eclipse last?", "answer": "The Earth orbits the sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometres. During a solar eclipse, the sun appears to pass through the moon's shadow. The total duration of a solar eclipse is typically a few hours. The duration of totality - when the sun is completely obscured - is typically less than one minute. The distance between the Earth and the moon is about 384,000 kilometres.

I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "Krishnamurti is not so well known in the West as he was in the past, and he is not as well known in the East as he was in the past. But his teachings are really revolutionary, and his ideas are profound. If you have read some of his books, for example, \"On Freedom\", you would have got an idea of what he is talking about.\n\nIn Krishnamurti's teachings, he is not talking about any specific religion or philosophy.  He does not teach any dogma.  He invites people to inquire into the nature of their own minds and think about the true meaning of life.  He reminds people that they already have everything that they need, because they are born with intelligence and wisdom.  He challenges people to look into their own minds and see what is going on.  He invites people to take a critical look at their own beliefs and ideas.  He does not accept any of people's beliefs, but he accepts the individual.  He invites people to look at their own minds and to be aware of their own thinking process.  He invites people to observe their own thoughts and to understand what is going on with their minds.  This is really the essence of what he is teaching.\n\nWhen he talks about education, he says that the purpose of education is not to accumulate knowledge, but to understand the process of thinking.  He believes that the most important thing is to understand your own mind.  He says that the most important subject is not math or science or history, but the subject is \"how to think\".  He says that the most important skill is not how to memorize, but how to learn.  He says that the most important quality is not knowledge, but understanding.  He says that the most important ability is not intelligence, but awareness.  He says that the most important quality is not expertise, but discernment.  He says that the most important quality is not information, but insight.  He says that the most important quality is not certainty, but openness.  He says that the most important quality is not judgment, but discernment.  He says that the most important quality is not dogma, but freedom.\n\nKrishnamurti's teachings are not about any specific religion or philosophy, but they are about the nature of human mind.  They are about the process of thinking.  They are about the essence of what it means to be human.  When you read his books, you feel that his teachings are really revolutionary, because they are really challenging the way we think.  They are challenging the way we look at life.  They are challenging the way we educate our children.  They are challenging the way we approach the practice of martial arts.  His teachings are really profound and they are really deep.  If you are interested in his ideas, I would recommend that you read some of his books, for example, \"On Freedom\", \"On Love\", \"On Education\", and \"On Violence\".  I hope this helps."}

This ability is crucial for understanding the past and learning from it. When it comes to understanding the present and planning for the future, historical information becomes even more valuable. For example, the weather today will be quite different from the weather yesterday because the sun is moving across the sky and the earth is rotating. This is a simple example of how the present is shaped by the past. If we didn’t have any historical information about past weather and sun positions, it would be very difficult to accurately predict the weather for the coming days. Similarly, if we didn’t have any historical information about past societies, it would be very difficult to understand how our current society came to be, and what the future of our society might be. By documenting and storing historical information, we are preserving our past and using it to make informed decisions about our present and future."}

It was proposed by TransCanada, a Canadian energy company. The project was first proposed in 2005.\n\nThe pipeline would have crossed the border at Morgan, Montana, and terminated at the oil hub in Patoka, Illinois. From there, the oil would have been transported by other pipelines to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The pipeline was to be constructed in the United States, but owned and operated by a Canadian company. \n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration denied a permit for the pipeline's construction, citing environmental concerns. President Trump issued a presidential permit for the pipeline in 2017. In 2019, a federal judge ordered a halt to construction of the pipeline pending further environmental review. The Trump administration appealed the decision."}

In modern computing, virtualization is commonly implemented using software that creates a virtual version of the underlying hardware (e.g., a virtual machine (VM) monitor). The software provides resources to the virtual machine (VM) that allow the VM to run as if it were running on the actual hardware, while the VM actually runs on the host machine. This allows multiple virtual machines to run simultaneously on the same physical hardware, each unaware of the existence of the others. This is called virtual machine virtualization, and is the dominant use of the term.\n\nA cloud is a pool of hardware, software, and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. The cloud model is based on abstraction, where the details of the hardware and software below the cloud layer are hidden by a higher-level interface. This enables the rapid scaling of resources up or down to match demand. Virtualization is one enabling technology for cloud computing, as it allows multiple independent VMs to run on the same physical hardware.\n\nMost of the basic functions of current virtualization software are inherited from this early VM OS.

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

{"id": "koala_142", "prompt": "What niches are not being fulfilled on the YouTube platform?", "answer": "YouTube's mission is to give everyone a voice, and provide access to information for everyone.  This has led to a broad-reaching platform that allows many different types of content.  Some niches that are not being fulfilled include:\n\n- Live Sports - There is a lot of interest in live sporting events, but there are few companies that are able to broadcast these for free in a quality stream.  YouTube has recently started to experiment with live broadcasts of sporting events, but they do not currently have the capability to provide a high quality viewing experience.  This leaves consumers with few options to view live sporting events.\n- TV - There is a lot of interest in watching TV shows and movies on YouTube, but the platform does not have the ability to provide content in a way that is similar to cable or satellite TV.  This leaves consumers with few options to watch popular TV shows or movies.\n- Local Content - YouTube has local offices in many different countries around the world, but these offices have little control over the content that is uploaded from their country.  This results in a lot of content being uploaded from users in that country, but not all of this content is relevant to the viewers in that country.  This leaves viewers with few options to find local content that is relevant to them."}
{"id": "koala_143", "prompt": "in billiards what happens if on the break every strip ball is pocketed?", "answer": "In billiards, a \"stripe run\" is a sequence of shots in which all of the object balls are either struck with a stripe-patterned cue ball or result in the cue ball becoming contact with a stripe-patterned object ball. The stripes are white, and the spots are colored. \n\nIn a break, the first shot of a game of billiards, a stripe run is called a \"solid break\". If one or more of the object balls are pocketed on the break, it is called a \"foul break\". If the breaker pockets all of the object balls on the break, it is called a \"perfect break\". A \"scratch\" is an imperfect break, where at least one of the object balls is not pocketed, or the breaker commits a foul.\n\nIf none of the object balls are pocketed on the break, it is called a \"miss\". A \"partial\" or \"weak\" miss is one in which one or more of the object balls is close to a pocket, but not pocketed. A \"strong\" miss is one in which none of the object balls are close to a pocket.\n\nIf the breaker commits a foul on the break, they must take the cue ball in hand behind the headstring, and the incoming player (the opponent of the breaker) has a number of options:\n\nIf the breaker had committed a \"serious\" foul (such as jumping ship, hitting an object ball more than once, or striking a cushion with the cue ball), then the incoming player has the option of either:\n  * shooting, and their first shot is called a \"push\".\n  * stating \"foul\", and the incoming player's first shot is also a foul, but they are awarded possession of the table.\n\nIf the breaker had committed a \"minor\" foul (such as striking a ball with the cue ball or the rack), then the incoming player's first shot is also a foul, but they are not awarded the table.\n\nIf the breaker had committed a \"wild\" foul (such as striking the cue ball with an object ball, or contacting the cue ball with anything other than the tip of their cue), then the incoming player's first shot is a foul, but they are awarded the table, and the breaker loses their turn and all remaining turns at the table."}

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window. However, a single pane window can never be more efficient than a double pane window. This is because the energy required to heat the inside of a window in a cold climate is proportional to the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the window. In other words, for a given window, the energy needed to heat the inside of the window increases as the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the window decreases. Therefore, for a window in a cold climate, the larger the difference between the inside and outside temperature of the window, the more efficient the window is. In order to achieve a larger temperature difference, you need to have a larger pane of glass. Therefore, a double pane window will always be more efficient than a single pane window in a cold climate."}

As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals. While they both share a common ancestry, their experiences have been shaped by economic and social factors. For example, African Americans often faced discrimination and had fewer economic opportunities. This led to their communities facing structural inequalities and poverty. While African cultures did not face the same level of discrimination, they were exploited and colonized by European powers, which impacted their social and economic development. Despite these differences, both groups share a common African ancestry and have similar musical, culinary, and religious practices. Understanding their differences and commonalities is important to develop a deeper understanding of how history and culture shape our identities."}
{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript.  One of the features of TypeScript is that it enforces type safety.  TypeScript also allows for a concept called \"duck typing\".  Duck Typing is the ability to cast one object to another object, even if the two objects do not have the same type.  For example, in JavaScript you could cast a number to a string.  TypeScript allows you to cast a number to a string, so long as the number can represent a valid string.  In TypeScript, the number \"123\" can be cast to a string because the number 123 can be represented as the string \"123\".  However, in TypeScript you cannot cast a number to an object because the number \"123\" cannot be represented as the string \"123\".  The string \"123\" only has 3 characters, and an object can have any number of characters.  So, in summary, TypeScript allows for duck typing, but only if the object being cast has a type that can be represented by the value being cast."}

{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "1. Food security: to achieve food security, Africa must double its agricultural production by 2050. This requires addressing challenges such as limited access to land, labor and inputs, high production costs, inadequate infrastructure and markets, and climate change.\n2. Agricultural productivity: Africa must increase agricultural productivity in order to double production by 2050. This can be achieved by improving soil fertility, crop varieties, irrigation, agricultural extension services, market infrastructure, and access to finance.\n3. Climate change: Africa's agriculture is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with potential impacts including decreased crop yields, droughts, soil degradation, and the spread of pests and diseases. Adaptation measures include diversified farming systems, improved seed varieties, greater use of water harvesting and storage, and the promotion of tree planting.\n4. Land tenure: Secure land tenure is a prerequisite for investment in agriculture, particularly for smallholder farmers. In Africa, laws that give recognition to the rights of women to own and control land are particularly lacking.\n5. Financing: Africa's agriculture sector is underfunded, with financing needs estimated at $13 billion to $21 billion per year. This is due to a range of constraints, including insufficient financial infrastructure, poor access to markets, and low incomes.\n6. Youth engagement: The agriculture sector offers many opportunities for young people, including employment, self-employment, and entrepreneurship. However, many young people in Africa are disengaged from agriculture, due to a lack of interest, inadequate education and training, and limited access to financing and markets.\n7. Technology adoption: Agricultural technologies such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation could significantly increase yields and incomes, but are underutilized in Africa. This is due to lack of awareness, limited availability, high costs, and poor infrastructure."}

This is because films usually have a beginning, middle, and end, while TV shows often have multiple arcs spanning over multiple seasons.

Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "This story was told from the perspective of a Nigerian man who won the American visa lottery. He moved to the United States and immediately faced multiple challenges and obstacles, some of which were the result of a cultural gap between him and other Americans. In particular, one of the most prominent themes that stood out to me was the disillusionment of the American Dream. The main character, Jumping Monkey Hill, felt this disillusionment after he arrived in America and realized that the American Dream was not as accessible as he had been led to believe. Instead, he found himself working multiple jobs, struggling to pay the bills, and living in an apartment with multiple other Nigerian immigrants. This theme was further illustrated by the motif of \"Jumping Monkey Hill,\" which was a reference to a children's book that was shared between the main character and his sister that depicted the American Dream in a positive light. The monkey in the book was able to jump higher and higher, and eventually jumped so high that he reached the American Dream. However, the monkey failed to realize that the book ended with him falling, which was an indication that the American Dream was not actually attainable. The main character was forced to confront this harsh reality when he was unable to find a job as a software engineer, despite having a degree from a prestigious university in the United States."}

When you have sarcoidosis, your immune system makes clumps of cells called granulomas that form in different parts of your body. These clumps can lead to inflammation and damage to your organs.\n\nSarcoidosis can affect any part of the body. Your organs most commonly affected are your lungs, your eyes, and your skin.\n\nNobody knows what causes sarcoidosis. It most commonly affects young adults age 20 to 40. But you can get it at any age. It affects women more often than men.\n\nIf you have sarcoidosis, your doctor may give you a treatment called steroids to help control your symptoms. If your symptoms don’t go away after taking steroids, your doctor might also give you a treatment called an immunosuppressant, which can help prevent your immune system from attacking your organs.\n\nYou may also need to have some tests to check how sarcoidosis is affecting your organs. One common test is a chest X-ray. If your doctor thinks your sarcoidosis may be affecting your heart or brain, you might have an MRI or a CT scan to check for damage.\n\nThere’s no known cure for sarcoidosis. But many people who have it lead healthy, active lives."}

He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.<br>He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old <br>car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month.<br>Furthermore this percent of loss increases of `0.5` percent <br>Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.<br>Can you help him?<br>How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, <br>and how much money will he have left over?", "answer": "Let's call the price of the old car $x, the price of the new car $y, the monthly decrease in the price of the old car $u, and the increase in the price of the new car $v. The man can save $1000 per month. Each month he will have $1000 less than before, as the price of the car he owns decreases by $u, and the price of the car he wants to buy increases by $v.\n\nWe can use the formula for the compound growth rate to find the number of months it will take him to save up $1000. This is: $1000 / (r - u) = 1000 / (0.015 - 0.01) = 1000 / 0.005 = 200 months, or 16.67 years. After 16.67 years, the price of the old car will have decreased by 1000 times 16.67, or 166.7, times the monthly decrease, u, or 166.7u. So after 16.67 years, the price of the old car will be $2000 * 166.7u, or $3336.7. The price of the new car will have increased by 1000 times 16.67, or 166.7v, or 166.7v times the increase per month, v, or 166.7v * 0.015, or $259.30. So the total cost of the new car will be $8000 + $259.30 = $8259.30. After 16.67 years, the man will have saved $1000 * 16.67, or $16670. So he will have $8259.30 - $16670 = -$7983.30."}

{"id": "koala_176", "prompt": "7 / 7Write a detailed patent writing for an innovative and novel way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as a digital certificates,  that is non-obvious using verifiable credentials, digital wallet on a blockchain as payment provision, and machine learning. Include claims on detailed processes involved, system architecture and algorithms", "answer": "Community Tax Certificate (CTC) is a government issued document that is required to be obtained by every individual and business entity residing in a particular geographical area. The certificate is issued by the local governing body and contains details of the entity and its address. The certificate has to be renewed annually. Currently, the process of acquiring the CTC is manual and involves visiting the government office, filling up multiple forms, submitting supporting documents, and paying fees. The process is error prone and time consuming.\n\nThere is a need for an innovative solution that can automate the process of issuance of CTC and all other permits and clearances. The solution should be secure, scalable, and be accessible to a large number of people. The core requirements of the solution are:\n\n1. It should be possible to issue a digital CTC that can be verified using verifiable credentials.\n2. Payment for the CTC should be facilitated using a blockchain based digital wallet.\n3. The system should use machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent and incorrect information.\n4. The system should be secure, scalable, and fast.\n\nThe proposed solution leverages blockchain technology to enable issuance of digital CTCs. The blockchain serves as a distributed ledger that maintains the following information about a particular entity:\n1. Name of the entity\n2. Address of the entity\n3. Date of issuance\n4. Expiry date\n5. Digital CTC\n\nThe blockchain is programmed to maintain this information in an immutable and tamper-proof manner. The information in the blockchain can be queried by anyone using a read-only permission. However, in order to write to the blockchain, a user has to be authenticated using a verifiable credential. For example, the government can issue digital CTCs only to entities that have submitted their identity proof and address proof.\n\nThe blockchain also maintains information about transactions performed between different entities. This information can be leveraged to detect fraudulent and incorrect transactions. For example, if the blockchain maintains information about the CTCs issued to a person, it can be used to detect a scenario where the same person obtains multiple CTCs for the same address.\n\nThe solution also leverages digital wallets to facilitate secure and easy payments. The blockchain maintains the digital wallets of different entities and allows them to transfer value between each other. For example, the government can setup a digital wallet and allow citizens to pay for the annual CTC renewal fee using the digital wallet.\n\nThe proposed solution leverages the core concepts of blockchain and machine learning to provide a secure, fast, and scalable platform for issuance of digital CTCs and other permits and clearances."}
{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " of ([c (((c ((c (((c ((c ((["}
