{"id": "koala_2", "prompt": "List the layers of the TCP/IP model and for each layer identify one protocol.", "answer": "The TCP/IP model is a conceptual model used to organize and visualize the architecture of internetworking. The model consists of four layers: the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the physical layer. At each layer, a set of protocols facilitates the exchange of data between nodes on the network.\n\nAt the application layer, the protocols enable applications to communicate with each other in a manner that is independent of the underlying network. Among the protocols that operate at the application layer are the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used to establish a reliable connection between applications, while UDP is used for applications that require fewer network resources or do not need a guaranteed delivery of data.\n\nAt the transport layer, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are used to establish a reliable connection between applications. TCP is used to transmit data in a sequential order, while UDP is used for applications that require fewer network resources or do not need a guaranteed delivery of data.\n\nAt the network layer, the Internet Protocol (IP) is used to route data between applications. IP supports a variety of data transfer services and provides addressing and routing of data traffic across the network. Network layer protocols are responsible for establishing connections between network devices, routing data across a network, and managing network resources.\n\nAt the physical layer, the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is responsible for managing transmission between network devices in a wired or wireless network. The MAC layer is responsible for controlling access to the network by devices and allocating network resources to support data transmission."}

Banks have a certain amount of equity, which is the owners' investment in the bank. The equity is the most senior capital and therefore has the highest claim on the bank's assets, ahead of the subordinated bonds and deposits, which are junior capital. It is important for banks to maintain a certain level of equity in order to absorb potential losses and protect the owners' investment."}

", "answer": "Gandalf the Grey was a wizard, who lived in the Shire, the setting of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf was one of the Istari, or Wizards, sent to Middle-earth to support the Free Peoples in their struggle against the Dark Lord Sauron. He was accompanied by an Istari named Radagast the Brown, and together they were known as the Wizards of the North. In The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf's primary goal was to ensure that the One Ring did not fall into the hands of Sauron or his servants. He also made several trips to the Shire, a peaceful land ruled by a Hobbit named Frodo Baggins. One of Gandalf's most important missions in the Shire was to protect Frodo from the evil Ringwraiths, and he ultimately succeeded in delivering the One Ring to the fires of Mount Doom, thus ensuring its destruction.\n\nIn 2963, Gandalf visited an inn in Bree to meet the Hobbits Frodo Baggins and his cousin, Samwise Gamgee. While staying at the inn, Gandalf learned that the Ringwraiths were searching for Frodo, and he warned the Hobbits to leave Bree as soon as possible. Gandalf and the Hobbits set out together for the Shire, but they were ambushed by the Ringwraiths, who captured Frodo and carried him away. Gandalf pursued the Ringwraiths, and after a long chase, he managed to overtake and slay them all, except for the Lord of the Nazgûl. The Ringwraiths fled, and Gandalf returned to the Shire to inform Frodo's relatives of the danger he faced.\n\nSometime later, Gandalf resumed his quest to find Frodo and the Ring. In 3018, he left the Shire and traveled to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, where he met King Théoden, the ruler of Rohan, and his son, Éomer. Gandalf advised the King and the Prince on the growing threat of Sauron, and he also warned them of the Ringwraiths, who had been terrorizing the countryside. After learning of the danger facing the inhabitants of Minas Tirith, Gandalf and his companions traveled to the nearby city of Osgiliath, where they attempted to protect the city from the Ringwraiths. However, the Wraiths managed to enter the city, and, in a desperate battle, Gandalf was captured by the Lord of the Nazgûl, who branded him with the rune for \"Morgul.\"\n\nGandalf was tortured and imprisoned in the tower of Orthanc, where he was tormented by the voice of the Dark Lord. Eventually, Gandalf was rescued by the Hobbits Merry and Pippin, who were traveling through Rohan. The Hobbits persuaded Gandalf to accompany them to Minas Tirith, where he joined the forces of Théoden and Éomer in their battle against Saruman, the leader of the army of Sauron. Gandalf wielded his staff to great effect in the Battle of the Hornburg, and he also helped the King and his army to escape the besieging forces of Sauron. In 3019, Gandalf and his companions traveled to Fangorn Forest, where they met Aragorn, a descendant of the kings of Gondor, and the Hobbits Legolas and Gimli. Gandalf revealed that he was an Istari, and he explained that the purpose of the Istari was to observe and advise the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Gandalf warned Aragorn that Sauron was gathering his forces for an attack on the Shire, and he urged the Hobbits to hasten their journey home.\n\nAfter saying farewell to Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, and Gimli continued their journey to the Shire. They traveled through the forest of Mirkwood, and they then crossed the river Anduin. When they reached the outskirts of the Shire, they met Frodo, Sam, and their friend Merry. Gandalf's companions provided Frodo with a safe haven in Fangorn Forest, while Gandalf and the Hobbits set out for the village of Bree. In Bree, Gandalf met with Aragorn, who was now serving as the King of the Reunited Kingdom, and he explained that Frodo planned to"}

Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.

I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": " in, and. and in and. h and. and in the and w-bet and and and in, and and or and s and and., and. in and, or al and and in. and \"b and w. and [c. to to and to(b to in and and and and and of more of of of. of and of.. and and and and in., in and and,. and d of un. of. of and , of.. and. and and, s and and. c un-st and. to ch [h and d. d, and.. d in. in m, co and, and, and.,., [(c,...., in [c. 2(in b and in to, as as as [B as [C and [d my [A of and through in my...and in.c in and and and-P in t-N(M and and in. and. in..,[A....[re,[A and of and of of and of the of A, of of the of of of of of s. of the."}

Ideology is often defined as a set of ideas that are presented as true, and that involve a set of ideals and goals, and that form an organized way of thinking about things.\n\nThe relationship between inconsistency and ideological thinking is rooted in the idea of a fixed perspective, or a rigid set of beliefs that are not open to change or revision. If an ideological perspective is held to be true, any evidence or information that challenges these beliefs is likely to be perceived as threatening or even invalid. This can lead to a lack of flexibility, which can lead to errors or even inaccurate data, as well as stifling innovation and discouraging creative thinking. It can also lead to a situation where new or contradictory information is not fully considered, or can even be discounted or ignored.\n\nAs a result, inconsistency can often be viewed as a threat to an ideological perspective, and can be used as a means to justify or rationalize the rejection or suppression of new information or ideas.

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration.

It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "L and a new way."}
{"id": "koala_50", "prompt": "Mill vs Gartner\nThis case is about a dispute over the right to dig clay on a piece of land. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

The money you invest is called a capital investment, and it is your money that goes into the stock market. If you buy 100 shares of stock with $1,000, your capital investment in the stock is $1,000.\n\nAfter you have invested in the stock, the stock you have purchased can be traded by the owners of the stock (the shareholders). A stock is a share in the ownership of a company, so if you have invested in a company's stock, you are a part-owner of that company, and you can buy, sell, or trade your shares in the stock market. This is how your money moves through the stock market from your pocket to the company you have invested in.\n\nNow imagine that you have invested in 100 shares of stock from Company XYZ. You have $1,000 in your pocket, and you have invested it in Company XYZ's stock. Now, let's say that you want to sell your shares of Company XYZ, and you want to get your money back. How do you do this?\n\nThe stock market is a place where companies can sell their stock to investors, and investors can buy and sell stock in companies. If you want to sell your shares of Company XYZ, you can contact a stock broker, who will be able to help you sell your shares. The stock broker will take your shares of Company XYZ, and sell them to another investor, who will then buy those shares. After the sale is complete, the money you receive from the sale will go back to your pocket, and this is how you get your money back.\n\nNow let's go back to the example of Company XYZ. Say that Company XYZ does well, and its stock price increases. If you sold 100 shares of Company XYZ's stock, and you bought them when their stock price was $20 per share, and you sold them for $40 per share, you would have made a profit of $2,000 (100 shares x ($40 - $20) = $2,000). If your money went to your pocket when you sold the shares, then it would go back to your pocket with the profit you made from the sale of your shares."}

Each element has a shape and size that represents a portion of the physical structure and an associated set of properties such as stiffness and mass.\n\nThe finite element mesh is used to approximate the geometry and behavior of the physical structure. The approximation is performed by discretizing the model into a mesh of elements and solving the equations of motion for the elements. The finite element mesh is updated at each iteration of the solution process to account for the response of the physical structure due to the applied loads and boundary conditions. The updated finite element mesh is solved iteratively to obtain the model’s response. The updated finite element mesh is used to construct a mesh for the next iteration, and the process repeats until the solution converges."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth.

This is a simple tool that can help you to slow down, take a breath, and become more intentional about the way that you respond. Below are a few ways that you can incorporate the pause ritual into your daily routine.\n\n1. Start each day with a few minutes of quiet reflection. This can be done lying in bed, sitting on your bedroom floor, or even while taking a stroll outside. This time is a great opportunity for you to connect with yourself and set intentions for the day ahead. You can use this time to write in a journal or to reflect on your thoughts and feelings. When you take a pause and connect with yourself, you create space for self-awareness and mindfulness, which can help you to be more present and intentional in your daily life.\n\n2. Practice slowing down throughout your day. Take a few deep breaths when you feel stressed or overwhelmed, or take a quick walk or stretch to move your body and recharge your mind. Try to incorporate small moments of self-care into your daily routine, and make time for activities that help you to recharge, relax, and reconnect with yourself.\n\n3. Use the pause ritual to help you to become more intentional about the way that you respond to stressful situations.

A pause ritual can help you to connect with your emotions and respond in a more thoughtful and intentional way."}

Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

In 2018, the African Union (AU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) adopted the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) initiative, which aims to promote air transport connectivity and liberalization in Africa. The SAATM initiative seeks to achieve the following objectives: to create an effective, efficient, and seamless air transport market across the continent; to enhance intra-African trade and tourism; to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth and job creation; to increase the continent’s share of global air traffic; and to facilitate internationalization of African airlines.\n\nRegional economic communities, such as the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community, are also working on improving air connectivity through the development of regional aviation master plans. For example, the Southern African Development Community Aviation Master Plan (SADCAM) 2040 aims to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the Southern African aviation industry, liberalize trade, and facilitate intra-regional aviation development.\n\nIn addition, African governments are working on improving air connectivity through the expansion of airport infrastructure. In 2017, IATA and the African Airlines Association published a study on the contribution of African airports to global connectivity. The study identified the top 100 airports by passenger numbers in Sub-Saharan Africa and assessed their contributions to global connectivity. The top 10 airports in Sub-Saharan Africa by passenger numbers in 2016 were: Cairo International Airport, OR Tambo International Airport, Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, King Shaka International Airport, Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Murtala Muhammed International Airport, O. R. Tambo International Airport, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Mbeya Airport, and Durban International Airport. The study found that the top 10 airports in Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 41% of the region’s total passenger traffic in 2016.

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "The efficiency of a window is determined by the amount of solar energy that can be transmitted through it. The efficiency of a window is measured by its solar transmittance, which is the percentage of solar radiation that can pass through a window. The higher the solar transmittance, the better the window is at transmitting solar radiation.\n\nThe solar transmittance of a double pane window is higher than that of a single pane window. It can transmit about 90% of the solar radiation.\n\nSingle pane windows are not very efficient because they transmit most of the solar energy into the room, which causes the room to be warmer. Therefore, they are not very effective in reducing the cooling load.\n\nDouble pane windows are more efficient than single pane windows. In moderate climates, double pane windows can reduce solar heat gain by up to 50% compared to single pane windows.\n\nIn cold climates, double pane windows can reduce heat loss by up to 40% and reduce solar heat gain by up to 70% compared to single pane windows.\n\nTherefore, it is more energy efficient to replace a double pane window with a triple pane window than to replace a single pane window with a double pane window.\n\nIn addition, the installation of Low-E coatings on the glass can further improve the energy efficiency of windows."}
{"id": "koala_149", "prompt": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment?", "answer": "The ethics of violence espoused by Fanon, Zizek, and Kahane can be understood through a set of commonalties. First, they all advocate for a rejection of liberalism, and a rejection of the belief that capitalism and democracy can ever be reconciled. Second, they all call for a return to an ethics of violence, or what they call “the violence of the weak.” Third, they all see the possibility of revolutionary violence as a way to challenge the hegemony of capitalism and imperialism, and in so doing, create a more just society. These three commonalities can help us to understand their overlapping ethics of violence, but also the ways in which they differ from one another.\n\nFanon, Zizek, and Kahane all reject liberalism and the idea of liberal peace, and they all place their hopes in revolutionary violence as a means to achieve their political goals. However, while Fanon and Zizek advocate for the use of revolutionary violence in the name of decolonization, Kahane’s ethics of violence is based on nationalism and the idea of a Jewish state. For Fanon and Zizek, revolutionary violence can be understood as a means to decolonize the oppressed and the colonized. In response to the colonial violence of European imperialism, they call for a rejection of liberalism and an embrace of revolutionary violence. They see the use of violence as a way to challenge the power structures that perpetuate oppression, and to create a more just and equitable society. For Kahane, on the other hand, the ethics of violence is a means to secure a Jewish state in the land of Israel. It is an ethics of violence that emerges out of Jewish nationalism, and that sees the use of violence as necessary to secure Jewish national interests. Unlike Fanon and Zizek, Kahane does not call for a rejection of liberalism, but rather, for the use of violence as a means to defend and promote the interests of the Jewish state.\n\nThe ethics of violence espoused by Fanon, Zizek, and Kahane can be understood through a set of commonalties.

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It's an open-source project maintained by Microsoft.\n\nTypeScript adds a few syntactic constructs to JavaScript, such as classes, interfaces, and module declarations, to make it easier to work with JavaScript in large, complex applications. These features make it easier to structure your code, track changes, and prevent bugs. In particular, TypeScript provides static typing, which means that the compiler can tell you whether two values are of the same type. This helps prevent common errors like mixing up string and number values, or accidentally passing an object to a function that expects a number.\n\nDuck Typing is a methodology whereby a type is determined by the behavior of an object, rather than by its class. In other words, a reference to an object of a given type is sufficient to use its methods, even if it's not an object of that exact type. This helps to avoid problems with \"mismatched types\" when working with inheritance and interfaces. Duck Typing also makes it possible for an object to implement multiple interfaces, or to be used as a parameter in multiple functions, without requiring an explicit cast."}

{"id": "koala_157", "prompt": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "answer": "Carbon fibers are used in the construction of lightweight, high-strength, and highly resilient materials, such as carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs). These materials are used in a wide variety of applications, such as aerospace structures, civil engineering structures, sports goods, and prosthetics. The use of CFRPs in buildings is especially widespread, as these materials provide high strength-to-weight ratios, low thermal expansion, and excellent stability under dynamic loads.\n\nCFRPs are made of carbon fibers, which are high-strength materials composed of thin fibers of carbon atoms that are arranged in a crystalline structure. The fibers are bundled together to form sheets, mats, or tapes, which are then impregnated with a polymer resin to form composite materials. These materials have a wide range of applications, including aerospace, automotive, sporting goods, and biomedical engineering.\n\nThe properties of CFRPs are determined by several factors, such as the type and orientation of the fibers, the resin matrix, and the volume fraction of the fibers. In general, carbon fibers are highly oriented, which gives them their high strength. The orientation of the fibers is controlled by an industrial process known as carbonization. Carbon fibers are also very stiff and have high modulus of elasticity, which means that they can withstand high tensile and compressive forces without breaking. The tensile strength of carbon fibers is typically around 1.9 GPa. In addition, CFRPs have low elastic moduli, high specific strength, and low density, which gives them excellent stability under dynamic loads.\n\nCFRPs are widely used in the construction of lightweight, high-strength, and highly resilient materials, such as composite materials for aerospace structures, civil engineering structures, and sporting goods. The high strength-to-weight ratio and low density of CFRPs make them ideal for applications in which weight and volume are important considerations, such as in the construction of aircraft and spacecraft, and in the manufacture of sporting goods. CFRPs can also be used to make lightweight structural components and structural reinforcements, which can reduce the weight of a structure without compromising its strength and stability. The high strength and stiffness of CFRPs also make them well-suited for use in civil engineering structures, such as bridges and buildings.\n\nCFRPs are used in a wide variety of sports and recreational equipment, such as bicycles, golf clubs, skis, tennis rackets, and baseball and softball bats. These materials are used in sports equipment because of their high strength, high stiffness, and low density. This combination of properties allows sports equipment made of CFRPs to be lightweight, yet highly durable, which provides a competitive advantage to athletes. In addition, CFRPs are able to absorb and dissipate energy, which helps to reduce the risk of injury."}
{"id": "koala_158", "prompt": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze", "answer": "\"Challenges for African Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Devèze\n\n1. Africa is the poorest continent. In 2012, 47% of the world's population lived under the poverty line of US$1.25 a day, and 40% of the world's population lived on less than US$2.50 a day. Africa is home to 16% of the world's population but contributes only 3% of global GDP and 1% of global trade.\n\n2. Africa has a very large population. The population of Africa is expected to double from 1.2 billion in 2015 to 2.4 billion in 2050, an increase of 1.2 billion people. This growth will occur in the face of limited natural resources, and could lead to increased urbanization and congestion, social instability, and environmental degradation.\n\n3. Africa has a limited agricultural area. Africa has 6% of the world's arable land, and only 10% of the world's fresh water resources. Agriculture accounts for 29% of the workforce and 10% of GDP in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n4. Agriculture is characterized by low productivity, low adoption of new technologies, and high food insecurity. Average agricultural yields are only 15% of those in developed countries; only 10% of arable land is used for agriculture; and only 5% of the population has access to improved agricultural technologies.\n\n5. Africa has limited access to electricity and modern infrastructure, which limits agricultural productivity and economic growth. 58% of the population did not have access to electricity in 2014, and only 35% of the population had access to improved drinking water sources.\n\n6. Africa has limited access to financial services, which limits agricultural productivity and economic growth. Only 23% of the population had access to a bank account or mobile money services in 2014.\n\n7. Africa has low levels of agricultural investment and low agricultural R&D spending. Agricultural R&D spending as a percentage of GDP was 0.25% in 2014, compared to 1.7% in developed countries.\n\n8. Africa is susceptible to climate change, which could have a significant impact on agricultural productivity. Climate change could increase temperatures, affect rainfall patterns, and contribute to droughts and floods, with negative implications for agricultural productivity."}

{"id": "koala_164", "prompt": "What are the wavelengths of light emitted by metals depending on their temperature?", "answer": "The wavelengths of light emitted by metals depend on their temperature. At low temperatures, metallic atoms tend to vibrate collectively in the crystal lattice, and this produces light with a characteristic wavelength that increases with decreasing temperature. At higher temperatures, the collective vibrations of the metal atoms become less ordered, and the wavelength of light emitted by the metal decreases. This can be explained by the fact that as the atoms vibrate more chaotically, their vibrations spread out, and the wavelength of light emitted by the metal becomes longer."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " -of of [of of –n of [or or (N (B: and ([ – at [N of and or -- of and –— and, (-n and, s of – and of a of a of of of of of of the of the of of and, of –F of of of [(N of (d of of [C –p of (n of and or of or or a at [t, a, [th, it and (t [P and w of or, of [m of a and-be of ((t of – –(c or of our of of of the of of (c of the of – and or and (f and?–P (d of? -dis of of [of of [(C of de of (N of (T of (c or of [S of and of and of [in of the of (C -c of (((in of (in -N by, and and of, and of our of of-w of – of an of of of, of of [of [– of of B of of of of of of of of of of of of of of – and of – of and of of [((f to of of of of of of of of and of or of (f of us of the ((c of (f of of of and of of of (of of of of. of of of of of ( of of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of of of of of [lo from of, of of – of of a of of of of the of of of of of of of of of or of of of of, of of of of [b of of of of the of of of of of or of of the of of of of of of of (of of of or of of (H of a of [c of C of the of of of of of of of of of of of-d of-of of of of of of of of d of of and of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of (of of [ch of of of [ of of of of of of of [(H [h of [h-C [f of n and of [t [t [h, of of our of of-[ of of of of of of of of s of w – and-D in a of or, of co of (of of it of,-C-H of – or of – d h and as out of the of of of [ of of the-C of of [-h(-(d [( in and to (, or l (( [ or c and (L or of-m and and ( (and and – [t-P and on our B and our, of h of-D S of of-h- [ ( (c- and (, of ( and- and of (( or of of (C of and of ( [c [in- ( ( (( or \"l (c and h ( ( ([ (t- ( and ( ( ( ( (-B [, of the of of of [, (t-L-F are of d of and of of the –-n- [of [ of or or of the of ( of of of - of L of of of of of of of l, and, and (n [, and [L (( [ of of ( and of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of H of [g of of of ( ( of of of of of-h of and-t-t (e-t al ( [ (c or, of [( of and (and of and h ((t-c,, of the of of of of of of of of of d of of of of of of of of ( and of of ( of – (-b-A and and, from of, of of of of of of and (ch. of of, ( of of ( ( of [ of of of [ of C [ of of of people of of of [ of [-H [M and de and ‘c of, [C of-of of of of of and of of of of c of. of O of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of, of of [of of P, (, for for, – for d, – and in, L in for of the [t of of and of ( and d of F [ of of of of and [ of and of of N of, ( and that ( [ and of [ of, of, of of, of of, of and ( of –, [t and and from ((“ [( [t of of, ("}
