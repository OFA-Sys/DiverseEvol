{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banks are not allowed to use cash as capital because it is too easy to convert cash into cash. This defeats the purpose of the capital buffer, which is to absorb losses and maintain financial stability.\n\nThe capital buffer serves as a cushion against losses, but it also helps banks maintain their liquidity. If a bank has enough capital, it can borrow more money from the financial markets when it needs money to lend to its customers. Without the capital buffer, banks would have to rely on deposits from their customers to meet their short-term cash needs, which could lead to a bank run. In such a situation, depositors would withdraw their money from the bank and it would not have enough cash to meet its customers’ demands. This could cause a chain reaction, leading to the collapse of the bank.\n\nBanks are also required to maintain a certain amount of capital, known as the minimum capital requirement, as a safeguard against losses. If a bank fails to meet the minimum capital requirement, it is considered to be undercapitalized. In this situation, the bank will not be able to borrow any money from the financial markets until it corrects the deficiency. This could cause the bank to collapse if the loss is too big. To avoid this situation, banks are required to have a capital buffer that is at least as large as their minimum capital requirement."}

{"id": "koala_6", "prompt": "Can you tell my a story about nuclear physics like dr Seuss?", "answer": "Let's take a look at a small, green, luminous ball called an atom. Inside the atom, there is a nucleus made up of positively-charged protons and neutrally-charged neutrons. Around the nucleus, there is a cloud of negatively-charged electrons.\n\nThe protons and neutrons in the nucleus are very small, but they have an extremely high mass. The electrons, on the other hand, are extremely light, but they have a very small mass. This means that the protons and neutrons are much more massive than the electrons, but the electrons have a much higher energy. The protons are so massive that they cannot be broken down even by the strong nuclear force, which is the force that holds the nucleus together. But the electrons are so light that they can be broken down by the electromagnetic force, which is a much weaker force but can still overcome the strong nuclear force.\n\nThe nucleus is held together by the strong nuclear force, but the electrons are held by the electromagnetic force. If the electrons were removed from the atom, the nucleus would lose its charge, and the atom would become electrically neutral. It would no longer be able to attract other electrons or ions, and it would fall apart. This is called ionization.\n\nAtoms can gain or lose electrons, which causes them to become charged. Positively-charged ions have more protons than electrons, while negatively-charged ions have more electrons than protons. When charged particles come close to each other, they attract or repel each other depending on their charges. This force is called the electrical force, and it is the same force that causes objects to attract or repel each other due to their electric charges.\n\nElectrons can move around within an atom, and they can jump from one atom to another. This is called the electromagnetic force, and it causes the atoms to stick together in molecules. The electromagnetic force is weaker than the strong nuclear force, but it is stronger than the weak nuclear force. The weak nuclear force causes some of the nuclei to break apart, but it is not strong enough to break apart the nucleus of an atom.\n\nElectrons can also absorb or emit energy as photons, which are particles of light. When an electron absorbs energy, it moves to a higher energy level, and when it emits energy, it moves to a lower energy level. This process is called electron transitions, and it allows the atom to absorb or emit light. This is how atoms can be seen in the visible light spectrum.\n\nElectrons can also emit or absorb energy as particles called neutrinos, which have no charge and very little mass. Neutrinos can move around inside an atom, but they cannot be absorbed or emitted by the electromagnetic force. Neutrinos can only move around inside the nucleus, but they are not affected by the strong nuclear force.\n\nAtoms can also absorb or emit energy as particles called gamma rays, which are high-energy photons. Gamma rays have much more energy than visible light, and they can cause chemical bonds to break. Gamma rays can also damage the cells in the body, and they can be harmful to humans.\n\nWhen an atom gains or loses electrons, its charge changes, and this can cause it to become an ion. Positively-charged ions have more protons than electrons, while negatively-charged ions have more electrons than protons. Ions are unstable, and they try to gain or lose electrons in order to become neutral. When an ion gains or loses an electron, it becomes charged with the opposite charge. For example, if a negative ion loses an electron, it becomes a positive ion with an excess of electrons.\n\nWhen atoms gain or lose electrons, they become charged ions. Positively-charged ions have more protons than electrons, while negatively-charged ions have more electrons than protons.

Morgoth transformed Manderville into a wolf and sent him to his lair to guard his treasure.\n\nFor several months, Manderville was forced to serve Morgoth, but one day, he was able to escape and return to his home. Upon his return, he found that the evil witch had conquered the land and enslaved the people. Manderville vowed to put an end to Morgoth and all of his evil.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Manderville fought valiantly to free the people, but Morgoth was too powerful and Manderville was forced to retreat. Morgoth was furious with his failure and ordered another of his servants, the Warlock of the Dark Forest, to capture Manderville.\n\nThe Warlock of the Dark Forest was a powerful being, but not as powerful as Morgoth. He and his minions captured Manderville and brought him to Morgoth's tower.\n\nMorgoth was furious that Manderville had escaped him again, and he was determined to make Manderville pay. He ordered the Warlock of the Dark Forest to transform Manderville into a wolf, and to keep him locked in a cage. Manderville was devastated, but he knew he had to find a way to escape.\n\nSeveral weeks passed, and Manderville was still being held captive. One day, he heard a strange howling outside his cage. The howling sounded familiar, and Manderville knew it was The Warrior of Light. Nashu had heard of Hildibrand's capture and had come to save him. He had also brought the Sword of Light with him, and he was determined to use it to restore Manderville to his normal form.\n\nThe Warrior of Light and Nashu fought their way into Morgoth's tower, and they were able to locate Manderville's cage. The Warrior of Light knew the Sword of Light would only work if he could find Manderville's true form, so he used the Sword to locate it. He then used the Sword to restore Manderville's human form, and the Warrior of Light and Nashu were able to defeat Morgoth and his servants.\n\nManderville was overjoyed to be free once again, and he vowed to continue his fight against evil. The Warrior of Light and Nashu bid Manderville farewell, and they returned to their world to continue their battle against the forces of darkness."}

Water safety engineering encompasses a wide range of topics, including hydraulics, hydrology, geotechnical engineering, construction, risk assessment, and environmental studies.\n\nWater safety engineering projects vary in size and complexity, and can range from a simple assessment of a body of water for the purpose of determining the risk of drowning, to the design and construction of large-scale water treatment and sanitation systems. Some of the most common water safety engineering projects are flood control and mitigation systems, which are designed to reduce the risks associated with flood damage, and water supply and sewage treatment systems, which provide communities with clean and safe drinking water and help to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases.\n\nDue to their critical nature, water safety engineering projects are usually completed by teams of engineers and technicians, and may involve a number of different stakeholders, including local governments, community members, and environmental and regulatory agencies. The main objectives of water safety engineering projects are to minimize the environmental, economic, and human impacts of water hazards, and to create safe and sustainable water systems that meet the needs of the communities they serve.\n\nThe following is a brief summary of some of the most common types of water safety engineering projects:\n\nFlood control and mitigation systems: Flood control systems are designed to reduce the risk of flood damage to properties and infrastructure, and to provide flood protection to communities. They typically involve the construction of flood walls, levees, dams, drainage systems, and pump stations, and can be combined with land use planning and development regulations to help manage flood risks in local communities. Flood control and mitigation systems can help to protect lives and property during floods, as well as minimize the economic impacts of flood damage.\n\nWater supply and sewage treatment systems: Water supply and sewage treatment systems provide communities with clean and safe drinking water, and help to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases. They typically involve the construction of water treatment plants, sewerage systems, and stormwater management systems, and can be designed to meet the needs of different communities, ranging from large cities to rural towns. Water supply and sewage treatment systems play a vital role in promoting public health and quality of life, and can significantly improve the social and economic well-being of communities around the world.\n\nHydraulic models: Hydraulic models are physical or computer-based representations of natural and man-made water systems, and are used to study the flow of water, and assess the potential impacts of floods, changes in water levels, and other hazards. Hydraulic models can be used to analyze the performance of flood control and mitigation systems, and to test the effectiveness of flood risk management strategies. They can also be used to predict the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on water systems, and to help guide the development of flood risk management plans.\n\nRiver restoration: River restoration is the process of improving the natural function and health of rivers and other water systems, with the goal of restoring their ecological and hydrological functions. It typically involves the removal of obstructions to improve the flow of water, the restoration of natural habitats, and the implementation of conservation and land management practices. River restoration projects can help to reduce flood risks, improve water quality, and provide ecosystem services, and can provide numerous benefits to communities and the environment.\n\nWater safety engineering projects are highly complex and require the expertise of a range of professionals, including civil engineers, hydrologists, geotechnical engineers, environmental engineers, water resource engineers, and structural engineers. They may also involve the participation of other stakeholders, such as government agencies, community members, and environmental and regulatory agencies. Water safety engineering projects are typically financed by governments, and can be carried out by public agencies, private companies, or a combination of the two.\n\nWater safety engineering projects are usually carried out in stages, with the first stage involving the planning and design of the project, and the second stage involving the construction of the project. They can take several years to complete, and may be subject to a number of regulatory and environmental requirements. Water safety engineering projects can produce a range of benefits for communities, and can help to reduce the economic and social impacts of water hazards"}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": ". in in a. and in our, in my in, in both in to in my in.. in, in, and in t in un in an s in our in my in in s un of my un s in in in in. un, to to to in to to in to in  as  and ( of C of of., of, of our,, in, ( and ( and, in and, and,, of. of of of of in of .. in in ( in ( in (� in and in, in un in  and.  in or b.. .(c... in.. in in., ([, ( ,.

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Inconsistency and ideological thinking are closely related insofar as ideological thinking is characterized by a lack of internal coherence and consistency. This lack of internal coherence and consistency is often a result of an attempt to justify or rationalize an ideology by manipulating or contorting one's own beliefs and values in order to make them seem more logical or reasonable. This is often seen in the form of cognitive dissonance, whereby individuals may try to reduce feelings of tension or discordance in their own beliefs and values by holding two contradictory views or beliefs at the same time and justifying their own ideology by rejecting or ignoring any information or evidence that contradicts their own beliefs and values. This is also often seen in the form of confirmation bias, whereby individuals tend to selectively search for or interpret information in a way that is consistent with their own beliefs and values, while simultaneously discounting or ignoring any information or evidence that contradicts their own beliefs and values. In this way, ideological thinking, or the tendency to hold and justify an ideology despite any contradictions or inconsistencies, is often rooted in a lack of critical thought and an inability to objectively evaluate and assess one's own beliefs and values."}

Gold is a virtual currency on Reddit, and can be used to \"gift\" other users or to purchase digital items from the Reddit store.\n\nAn admin is a user who has been given special privileges on a subreddit (a forum on Reddit). Typically, an admin is charged with helping to manage and moderate the subreddit, ensuring that it remains a positive, welcoming space for everyone. There are a number of different types of admin, each with their own set of responsibilities. As well as managing the forum, admins also have the ability to ban users, delete posts, and modify the rules for the subreddit. These actions can be controversial, and can sometimes result in backlash from the community, so it's important for admins to carefully consider their actions, and always act with the best interests of the subreddit in mind.\n\nAs an admin, you're often heavily involved with the community, so it's understandable that you might receive a lot of praise and positive feedback from users. However, it's important to remember that you're not doing this for the Reddit Gold.

The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help.

{"id": "koala_49", "prompt": "2 / 2Create a 2000 words article conversational article and Rephrase this with 100% no plagiarism and unique For the past month or so, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has received much attention within the tech community. ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " ialism."}

The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement.

The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

{"id": "koala_59", "prompt": "How can anti-deressants make people think or act suicidally? Suicidal thoughts or actions' are a side effect of every single anti-depressant I've seen. Is the medicine controlling your mind or something?", "answer": "Anti-deressants can make people think or act suicidally in two ways. First, some anti-deressants, such as citalopram, fluoxetine, and escitalopram, can cause a person to have suicidal thoughts or act on these thoughts. Second, some people who are depressed take anti-deressants to help improve their moods. When their moods improve, they may think that life isn't worth living anymore, or that suicide is an option.\n\nIn regards to the first way, some anti-deressants can cause a person to have suicidal thoughts or act on these thoughts. For example, a study in the British Medical Journal found that antidepressants can increase the risk of suicide in young people by 15-17%. This is because these medications can cause side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and mood swings. Some people may have suicidal thoughts or act on these thoughts when they experience these side effects.\n\nIn regards to the second way, some people who are depressed take anti-deressants to help improve their moods. When their moods improve, they may think that life isn't worth living anymore, or that suicide is an option. This is due to the fact that anti-deressants can lead to suicidal thoughts or actions. For example, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that anti-deressants can increase the risk of suicide in older adults by 10-14%. This is because these medications can cause side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and mood swings.

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The finite element method (FEM) is a computational technique used in engineering to solve problems that involve partial differential equations (PDEs). The technique is particularly useful in structural analysis, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism, as these problems involve PDEs that cannot be solved exactly using traditional numerical methods such as the finite difference method or the finite differences method. Instead, the FEM uses finite elements, which are discretized versions of the solution domain, to represent the continuous solution. The resulting system of algebraic equations is then solved using standard numerical methods such as the direct method or the iterative method."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": ",,, (, of,,,,, (gener, [., (gu, (d, (h of of the ( and of the and, of ( d [, ( or of the of the of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of ( of ( of (of of ( of (of ( of (-content of the ( (ist (ian in ((p (em ( (d (subject [ove ( [[ ( ( ( ( [[ [ (, (, the, (, or,,,-j, or ( ([h, h, (cont,, ( (,,, (,,,,, (.,,,,,,, of (of of, of, of,,,,, (inc, and,, (, or..,, ha, [H (,-in,, ([[., (In In,, ([h (f ( [., ( of ( of of of ( ( of of ( of (, of the of (of of ( of, of of of (h of [[ (C of of (of [d of [of [of [of of, (of of of [-l of ( (w of ((nam of (L (w (In (in, [H In.

{"id": "koala_85", "prompt": "Introduce the ”financial markets and institutions“ by Frederic S. Mishkin", "answer": "The financial markets and institutions are made up of a complex network that facilitates the transfer of wealth between investors and companies. It enables companies to raise the funds needed to invest in their business, and provides investors with the opportunity to invest their capital in return for a share in the profits. The financial system is critical to the functioning of the economy as a whole, and it enables both individuals and companies to plan and make long-term decisions with greater certainty.\n\nThe main function of the financial system is to allocate capital efficiently by connecting savers and borrowers. In simple terms, a saver deposits money in a bank, and in return the bank lends out this money to borrowers, who pay interest on their loans. The interest that savers receive on their deposits is income, which enables them to spend or invest their money, and the interest that borrowers pay to the banks is the cost of accessing capital. The financial system ensures that savings are efficiently allocated to those who can use them most productively, and that borrowers receive the funds they need to invest in their businesses or to purchase a house or a car.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions play a critical role in the financial system by acting as intermediaries between savers and borrowers. They collect deposits from savers, and use these funds to make loans to borrowers. Banks also invest a portion of their deposits in financial markets, which enables them to maintain a sufficient level of capital to allow them to lend to more borrowers. This process of intermediation enables the financial system to allocate capital efficiently, by matching savers and borrowers in a way that minimizes transaction costs.\n\nFinancial markets and institutions also play an important role in facilitating the flow of funds between countries by enabling the transfer of capital across national borders. The global financial system allows savers in one country to lend their money to borrowers in another country, and facilitates the movement of capital between investors in different countries. This enables companies and governments in different countries to access the financing they need to invest in their economies and grow their businesses.\n\nThe financial system is made up of a complex network of financial markets and institutions, including banks, investment firms, and insurance companies. The main financial markets are the money markets, debt markets, and capital markets. The money markets provide short-term loans to companies and governments, and function as a primary source of financing for businesses. The debt markets provide medium- to long-term loans to companies and governments, and are used by businesses to raise funds to invest in new projects and expand their operations. The capital markets provide long-term financing to companies and governments, and are mainly used by large businesses to raise funds for expansion and long-term investments.\n\nThe financial system is also made up of a large network of financial institutions, including banks, investment firms, insurance companies, and pension funds. Banks are the most important financial institutions in the financial system, as they play a key role in the intermediation of savings and the allocation of credit. They also act as financial intermediaries by borrowing money from depositors and lending it to borrowers. Banks engage in a wide range of banking activities, including taking deposits from savers, making loans to borrowers, and providing payment services to customers. Banks also invest a portion of their funds in financial markets, and use these investments to generate a return on their capital. As a result, banks have a significant impact on the functioning of financial markets by setting the cost and availability of credit in the economy.\n\nInvestment firms, such as private equity firms and mutual funds, invest on behalf of their clients by pooling their money and investing in a diversified portfolio of assets. Insurance companies provide financial security to individuals and businesses by managing risks and paying claims in the event of a loss or injury. Pension funds are collective investment vehicles that manage the savings of employees and provide retirement benefits to their members. They invest the money collected from their members in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, with the aim of generating a return on their investments.\n\nFinancial markets and institutions play a critical role in the economy by facilitating the exchange of money between savers and borrowers, and by enabling companies and governments to raise the funds they need to invest in their businesses and grow their economies.

Relax &amp; De-Stress\nIf stress or anxiety is keeping you up, a weighted blanket can help.

Combined with the serotonin and melatonin they help release, they help reduce racing thoughts and worries.\n\n\n3. Quality Materials\nWe believe in quality products that last.

Should I create a presale contract separate from main contract?", "answer": "You can use a smart contract to sell tokens to investors privately, which is called a \"presale.\" This is a common way to raise funds for a token. The smart contract can be set up to run until a certain date or when a certain amount of tokens have been sold.\n\nYou can use the same smart contract you use for the presale to launch the token on a public blockchain, such as Ethereum or Corda, using a launchpad. The launchpad is a mechanism for launching a token on a public blockchain. It allows you to create an ERC20 token (for Ethereum) or a Corda token (for Corda) without needing to build a whole new blockchain. Using the same smart contract for both the presale and the launchpad makes it easier to manage the token, as you only need to modify the contract once.\n\nYou can create a separate contract for the presale, but it's not necessary.

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

The activities of the company building the pipeline required the approval of the government, as it would have a significant impact on the community."}

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "In an ideal world, a single pane window would be more energy efficient than a double pane window.\nHowever, the performance of a single pane window is limited by the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the window material (which is usually glass), which can be as high as 0.75 W/mK for most common glass types.\nA double pane window can greatly improve energy efficiency by effectively reducing thermal conductivity through the use of a gas-filled space (usually air or argon) between the two panes. \nThis gas-filled space can reduce thermal conductivity by as much as 400 times, meaning that a double pane window with a thermal conductivity of around 0.03 W/mK will outperform a single pane window with a thermal conductivity of 0.75 W/mK.\n\nAs a result, a double pane window is generally more energy efficient than a single pane window.\nHowever, in certain climates with cold winters, a triple pane window can be more energy efficient than a double pane window. \nThis is because a triple pane window can further reduce thermal conductivity by adding a third pane of glass, creating an even more effective gas-filled space."}

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript. This means that TypeScript provides type-checking for JavaScript code, which helps to avoid common errors such as typos or uninitialized variables.\n\nDuck Typing is a programming paradigm in which the type of an object is determined by its behavior, rather than by its declaration. This means that it is possible to assign an object of a different type to a variable that is typed to expect a different type. This allows for greater flexibility and reduces the burden of maintaining type declarations.\n\nIn TypeScript, duck typing is implemented through the use of the \"any\" keyword. This keyword allows an object to be assigned to a variable of any type, as long as its behavior is consistent with the type expected by the variable. This allows programmers to write code that is more flexible and easier to maintain, without sacrificing type safety."}

", "answer": "Application of Heath’s book Upstream to the social workers at Visalia Unified School District was interesting. The description of the job duties and personal characteristics of the social worker align with the Heath book. The social workers interact with students, parents, and community members in a variety of settings. They are responsible for providing support and counseling to students, as well as assisting with classroom instruction. The social workers are required to have strong personal and academic counseling skills, as well as the ability to work with a diverse group of people. The social workers are expected to maintain a high level of professionalism, as well as excellent communication skills.\n\nThe social workers at Visalia Unified School District will be able to apply the concepts of the book to their work. Heath’s book describes how to “change the way we think about change” by using the metaphor of the river. He describes how we can think about change as a series of “leapfrogs” or “holes” rather than one continuous flow. This can help individuals or groups to think about change in a more manageable way. The social workers can use this metaphor to help students and their families to identify and address their challenges in an incremental manner. This can help students to feel more in control of their own lives, and prevent them from feeling overwhelmed by the changes that they are trying to make.\n\nThe social workers can also use the concept of “swim with the current” to help them to understand how to work with the environment in which they operate. By understanding the environment in which they work, the social workers can make an effort to align their efforts with the goals and vision of the community, rather than against them. This can help the social workers to feel more connected to their work, and to better understand the needs of the people they serve."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is a serious threat to human health and well-being, and to the environment. It is caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, that release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. This warms the Earth's surface and causes climate change, leading to increases in global temperatures, rising sea levels, and more frequent and intense natural disasters. Climate change is already being felt around the world, and its effects are expected to intensify in the coming years and decades.\n\nThe good news is that there are many things that can be done to stop and reverse climate change. The actions that can be taken at an individual, community, and national level include:\n\n* Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by making changes to our lifestyle and the way we consume resources, such as using public transport, eating a more plant-based diet, and avoiding single-use plastics.\n* Increasing energy efficiency by improving the energy performance of our homes and businesses, and by investing in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.\n* Preserving forests and other natural ecosystems by protecting them from deforestation and degradation, and by restoring damaged areas.\n* Adapting to the impacts of climate change by preparing for and responding to its effects, such as by building resilient infrastructure and adopting changes in our daily lives.\n* Raising awareness about the issue and urging decision makers to take action by signing petitions, writing letters, and participating in marches and other events.\n\nIn order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and limit global temperature rise to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, global emissions of greenhouse gases must be reduced significantly and reached net zero by the second half of the century. To achieve this, we need to work together to make urgent and meaningful changes in how we live and operate as a society. By taking collective action, we can prevent climate change, protect our environment, and create a healthier and more sustainable future for all."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "The answer to your question is because it is a matter of time investment. When you watch a film, you have to sit through it for at least an hour. This can be tiring and draining for your mind and body. When you watch 3 episodes of your favorite TV show back to back, you are only watching for a total of 3 hours. This allows your mind and body to recover as soon as you finish each episode. You will still feel invested and engaged in the story, but it is much less tiring and draining than watching a film."}

{"id": "koala_169", "prompt": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence?", "answer": "No, it is not rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence. In fact, believing things for which there is no objective evidence is generally considered to be unreasonable or irrational.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there are certain things that people can believe in the absence of objective evidence for those things. Some of these things include the existence of certain entities such as God or the supernatural, the existence of an afterlife, and the existence of free will. In these cases, it is possible to have a reasoned belief in these things. This is because these things are not empirically verifiable, meaning that they cannot be proven or disproven using scientific methods or other means of objective, empirical evidence. However, many philosophers and theists argue that there are reasons to believe in the existence of God, the supernatural, and the afterlife, and that these reasons are sufficient for having a reasoned, rational belief in these things."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " and (B in of the of ((ge (vent (C Cay to (R in [-P (M-J [tr – (-S (-d of or, -( of of( of a of ( of the of – of of of of of, of and of of of of of of of of of the of the (C (C of -[ve of of an of - of d ( –, h [h ( ( – - ( [’ ( of ( of un of c ((c of – - –, (ve and, e – of - or it ( as (, of or of of ( of the of of our of (,, ( and, and, (t, of, of the of ar of ( of people of ( of [((s of w of ( ( (C B ((ve ( or of people of in of ( of ( of (-ar ( (e of ( , ( ( (lo and [,, ( of, of of ( of of h of of of, of of of of of of of of of of of of - of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of - [-P of on of of of or of, of of ((C of h of of of – of [in in,, – and [of, of – of of ( of of of of of, of ( ( of of s of of of of of of by of of of, ( of of of of of of of of, of more of, of, of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of the as of of of of of of of of of of of of of, of of of of of of of of e of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of ( of of, of of of ( of n of of of of, of of, of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of [of ( of of d of of P of of ( – [ [ [ [( [em [ [ist of is of (-c [ra [ of at [ of of of of of of is of ‘ and of of of of - and – in, and [-B ( of and of of of, of ( of ( of of the of of of-t, and ( ( – on, ( H of of of of of of of the of ( of of of ( and ( ( (-P-J ( ( G B ( of C ( (( C T ( as (ale ( ( ( ( ( ( as B [  ( C C W, and of ( B( ( C ( A ( of ( of ( of C, [ (, or, [, ( ( of,, ( – ( of ( of of of of a in d of “ ( \" ( [ S ( (. and ( or (, D H ( C ( ( ( D ( \"[ (.

This can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe number of rows is 3 and the number of columns is 4, giving us a total of 12. Since each cell can take on a single value, the number of unique values possible is 12.\n\nThe number of possible combinations is 12!, or 403,200.\n\nThe number of possible permutations is 12! / 12!, or 403,200 / 12! or 3776. This is because each permutation is a combination, but not every combination results in a permutation. In order for a permutation to be valid, we must have a row containing all 12 values and a column containing all 12 values. Since each combination results in a unique permutation, it can be calculated as the number of permutations divided by the number of combinations.\n\nThe number of unique permutations is 3776."}
