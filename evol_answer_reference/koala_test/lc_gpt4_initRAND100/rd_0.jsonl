As a result, bank cannot utilize its cash as capital. If bank uses its cash as capital, it will result in a decline in cash. Since cash is a liability of the bank, a decline in cash is directly related to an increase in risk for the bank. This is because the obligation of the bank will increase with a decline in cash.

", "answer": "Hildibrand Manderville had been a most gentlemanly and pleasant young man, albeit a bit too much of a prig for some tastes. He was a man of means, a member of a prominent merchant family from the port of Portsmouth, who had recently come into an inheritance from a distant cousin. He was also a man of some talent, a poet who had written a number of minor works that were well received in his circle. He had recently decided to take a sabbatical and travel the world to experience new places and learn new languages. During his travels, he had met an old man named Nashu, who was travelling the world with a young woman named the Warrior of Light, and Hildibrand had joined them as a companion. They had been travelling for many months when they arrived in the forest of Tōfuku.\n\nA sudden, intense storm had broken out, and the Warrior of Light had been blown off course, and into a clearing in the forest. It was there that they had seen Gandalf the Grey, who was a wizard and a friend of the Warrior of Light. The storm had passed, and it had been Gandalf's task to protect the Warrior of Light from an evil presence in the forest, and he had been successful. However, afterwards, he had been overcome by a strange weakness, and was unable to leave the forest, and so the Warrior of Light and Nashu had stayed with him to protect him from the evil presence.\n\nHildibrand had found the Warrior of Light and Nashu to be a delightful couple to be around, and the Warrior of Light had explained to him that her and Nashu were travelling the world to find the Seven Stones of Light, which were said to be able to defeat an evil sorcerer called the Sorceror of Shadows. Hildibrand had found this story to be a bit far-fetched, but he had been impressed by the Warrior of Light's resolve and determination, and had offered to accompany them on their journey.\n\nThe Warrior of Light had been reluctant to accept Hildibrand's offer at first, but she had eventually relented, and they had set out together. They had travelled for many months, and had made many friends and allies on their journey, and had been successful in protecting the Seven Stones of Light from the Sorceror of Shadows. However, they had been unable to defeat him, and the Sorceror of Shadows had managed to steal the Seven Stones of Light. The Warrior of Light had been devastated by this, and she had been unable to speak for a while.\n\nAfter a time, Hildibrand had asked her if she would like to go for a walk, and they had gone for a stroll together along the riverbank. They had been walking for quite some time, and had not spoken a word the entire time. Hildibrand had eventually asked her if she was okay, and she had nodded, and Hildibrand had turned to him and said \"I'm fine, but I would like to tell you something.\" The Warrior of Light had looked up at him and said, \"Tell me.\" Hildibrand had hesitated for a moment, and then he had begun speaking. He had told her that he had always thought she was a bit too hard on herself, and that she should be more accepting of herself, and of her failures, and of her shortcomings. He had said that he thought she was a wonderful and courageous person, and that she should be proud of all of her accomplishments, instead of being so hard on herself. He had said that he thought she was a great person, and he had told her that he loved her.\n\nThe Warrior of Light had been touched and moved by Hildibrand's words, and she had smiled. She had replied that she felt the same way about him, and she had told him that she loved him. She had then pulled him in for a kiss, and they had spent the rest of the afternoon in each other's arms. That night, they had slept together for the first time, and they had made love in the morning, and they had been happy together."}

You are absolutely right that this time can be used to prepare for the next step in your career. For most PhD students, the first year of their program is dedicated to coursework and getting up to speed on the field. After that, the focus shifts to original research, which can last until graduation and sometimes beyond.\n\nOne thing to consider for the next year is whether you would like to work on your research or on some other project to gain practical experience. You can certainly do both, but it's important to decide which path would be better for you. If you are interested in gaining research experience, then you might consider working in a lab over the summer to get a feel for what it would be like to work in research. Some labs also offer paid positions or stipends for undergraduate students, so keep an eye out for those opportunities. You can also consider working with a professor on a smaller project, such as a literature review, data analysis, or writing a short paper. This would give you the chance to work with a professor, learn more about their research, and contribute to their work.\n\nIf you would like to get practical experience, then you might consider working in a different field. This could be anything from a lab to a company to a non-profit. Not only would this experience help you develop important skills, it would also show your interest in other fields and give you a chance to explore the workplace before you start a PhD program.\n\nIf you have not already, I would also recommend looking into conferences, meetings, and other opportunities for graduate students. These events bring together researchers from all over the world and provide a great opportunity to learn more about research and interact with people in your field.\n\nI hope this is helpful! If you have any questions, or would like to discuss this further, please let me know. Good luck!"}
{"id": "koala_10", "prompt": "Write an interview between a Female Film director and a journalist. Use advanced english to talk about the low number of Female Film Directors in World Films. Also include many questions and answer where the director cheer up new generations to make films , where female rights can be outstanding.", "answer": "The number of female film directors around the world is very low. Even in 2019, the number of women who have been nominated for the Oscars in the Best Director category is only 4, with only one woman winning a nomination. The lack of role models for young women has led to a low number of women entering the film industry, and even fewer becoming film directors. For example, a study in the U.S. found that between 1997 and 2012, less than 5% of the 2,100 films released by the top 250 Hollywood studios were directed by women. Although this is a very small percentage, this number has been improving over the years. In 2018, the number of female directors in Hollywood reached 11% for the first time.\n\nAn interview with a female film director can be a great way to shed light on the situation for young female filmmakers and encourage them to enter the industry. The following is an interview with a female film director, which was conducted by a journalist.\n\nInterviewer: You've been a film director for many years. It's rare to see a female film director in Hollywood. How have you managed to succeed in such a male-dominated industry?\nFemale Film Director: I've always been passionate about film, and I've always wanted to direct films. I was lucky to be able to study film in college, and I knew that if I wanted to direct films, I would have to work hard to become a director. I also knew that it would be very difficult for me to succeed in Hollywood, so I decided to study in Europe, where there are many more female filmmakers. I've been lucky to work with some of the most talented actors and crew members in the industry, and they've helped me succeed. My background in art and design has also helped me create visually stunning films, which has attracted a lot of attention.\n\nInterviewer: What do you think is the reason for the low number of female film directors in Hollywood?\nFemale Film Director: Hollywood is an industry based on money and power. It's very difficult for women to succeed in the film industry because there are so few women in powerful positions. For example, women make up less than 6% of executive producers in Hollywood, and only 25% of the board members of the major film studios are women. The lack of female mentors and role models in the film industry has also made it difficult for women to succeed.\n\nInterviewer: Do you think Hollywood is a sexist industry?\nFemale Film Director: I think Hollywood can be very sexist. For example, according to a study by the University of Southern California, female-led films make only 76 cents for every dollar that male-led films make at the box office. Hollywood also has a diversity problem. Although female directors rarely succeed in Hollywood, female directors from other parts of the world are even less successful. For example, only 2% of the 100 highest-grossing films worldwide in 2018 were directed by women.\n\nInterviewer: What advice would you give to young women who want to become film directors?\nFemale Film Director: I would say to follow your dreams and work hard. There will be many obstacles in your way, but if you're passionate about film and you work hard, you can achieve your dreams. Even if you don't succeed at first, don't give up. Keep working, and you will be successful."}

The story begins with a physician visiting a dying man named Ivan Ilych. The man is conscious, but in great pain. The physician suggests that he might be relieved by a change in position, but the man refuses, feeling that he has long since lost the right to make such simple requests. The physician then suggests that he might be more comfortable in his bed, but this request is also refused, as the man feels he should accept his fate with dignity. The physician then suggests that he might be more comfortable if someone were to read to him, but once again, the man refuses. The physician then suggests that he might be more comfortable if someone were to talk to him, but the man once again refuses, feeling that he should not burden anyone with his thoughts. The physician then suggests that he might be more comfortable if someone were to sing to him, but the man once again refuses, feeling that he should focus on his impending death. The physician then suggests that he might be more comfortable if someone were to pray for him, but the man refuses this as well, feeling that his death is too absurd to be worthy of prayers. The physician then suggests that he might be more comfortable if someone were to take care of his children. The man responds that he doesn't have any children, but the physician persists, saying that he is certain that the man does have children and that they need someone to take care of them. The man does not respond, and the physician leaves, leaving the man to his painful and lonely end.After the physician leaves, Ivan Ilych reflects on his life. As a young man, he had imagined that he would grow old, like his father, a highly respected civil servant. However, his father died young, and Ivan Ilych realized that he would not have the same respected position and comfortable life that his father had had. Instead, he was a civil servant like his father, but one who was considered a failure. He had worked hard and done his best, but that was not enough. He had been unable to achieve the success and social status that he had desired, and this failure had caused him to despise himself. He had married a woman he had grown up with, and they had had a son, but his wife had died. He had then remarried, but his second wife had died as well. He had then remarried a third time, and had had a second child, but his wife had also died. He had then remarried a fourth time, but his wife had died as well. He had then remarried a fifth time, but his wife had died as well, and his son had died as well. He had then remarried a sixth time, and his sixth wife had died as well.

He had then remarried a ninth time, and his ninth wife had also died. He had then remarried a tenth time, and his tenth wife had also died. He had then remarried a 11th time, and his 11th wife had also died. He had then remarried a 12th time, and his 12th wife had also died.

Carbohydrates are classified into three categories: simple carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, and dietary fibre. They can be digested by the human body and are a major source of energy.\n\nCarbohydrates are found in grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and legumes. Simple carbohydrates are generally found in processed foods such as cakes, cookies, and candy, as well as in table sugar, honey, and syrups. Complex carbohydrates are found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Dietary fibre is found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. As carbohydrates are digested, they are broken down into glucose, which is the main source of energy for the body.\n\nProteins are made of amino acids and are an important building block of the body. Proteins are necessary for growth and repair, and carry out many vital functions in the body, such as making enzymes, hormones, and other substances. Proteins are found in animal foods such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products, as well as in plant foods such as legumes, nuts, seeds, and some vegetables. Protein should make up 10 to 35% of a person's total calorie intake.\n\nFats are a class of organic compounds that are found in both animal and plant-based foods. They are made up of two elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Fats are essential for good health, as they are needed to absorb certain vitamins (A, D, E, and K), help with the absorption of calcium and iron, and provide energy. Fats can be broken down into saturated fats, monounsaturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature, such as butter, cheese, and lard. Monounsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature, such as olive oil, canola oil, and peanut oil. Polyunsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature, such as flaxseed oil, sunflower oil, and safflower oil. Fat should make up 20 to 35% of a person's total calorie intake."}

In the early spring, the quills in the family would shed their old quills, and Prickles would be the first quill to do so. She was very proud of her quills, and she would spend the entire day arranging them in her quill bun, a circular shape that was made from the tips of her quills. Prickles loved her quill bun, but she had a secret dream that she would one day be a seamstress. She would spend her days sewing beautiful clothes from the softest of materials, and she would be admired by everyone in the quill community.\n\nWhen Prickles was six years old, her family decided that she was old enough to start going out in the world. They gave her a small suitcase filled with quills, and Prickles set off to explore the world. She traveled for many days, and she met many interesting creatures along the way. She met a flock of feathered friends, and they told Prickles that they would be leaving for a long journey across the sea. Prickles decided that she would travel with the flock, and she told the quills in her suitcase that she would be back to visit them before the end of the year.\n\nAfter a long journey, the flock of feathered friends landed on an island, and they immediately began to explore. They walked through the woods, and they saw many beautiful flowers and leaves. They saw a small stream, and they decided to go for a swim. The water was refreshing, and the flock of feathered friends had a lot of fun splashing around in the water. They swam all the way across the stream, and they floated on the water for a while. The flock of feathered friends decided that they would continue their journey the next day, and they continued traveling towards the sea.\n\nThe next morning, the flock of feathered friends woke up and began their journey. They flew over the sea, and they eventually reached the shores of a large island. They landed on the island, and they began exploring. They walked through the grass and the trees, and they saw many beautiful creatures. They saw a herd of goats, and the flock of feathered friends decided that they would play a game of tag with the herd. The goats ran away from the flock of feathered friends, and the feathered friends chased after them. The feathered friends caught up to the goats, and they began to play tag with them.

Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": ".. and.... over and re \"comm \"c and st (in and and in al and in n and and and and and and and in in in or j in, and of j at t-in and at in. and to (. to and to b to and and and and and [p of of  of of at of.. of and and and and to (l in, of and, and and and of and of l and and of of.

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Ideological thinking refers to the way a person thinks or acts based on their set of beliefs, values, and principles. Inconsistency is the state of being inconsistent or incompatible. Inconsistency in ideological thinking may arise due to a number of reasons:\n\n* When people hold contradictory beliefs and values, their thinking can become inconsistent. For example, people may hold the view that it is wrong to discriminate against others, but at the same time, they may discriminate against people of certain social groups.\n* When people fail to apply their beliefs and values consistently across different situations, their thinking can become inconsistent. For example, people may believe that everyone has the right to live with dignity, but they may nevertheless engage in harmful practices like stealing, cheating, or bullying others.\n* When people hold beliefs and values that are not grounded in reason or evidence, their thinking can become inconsistent. For example, people may believe that a certain political candidate is the best choice for the nation, but they may not be able to provide any solid reasons as to why they believe this.\n\nInconsistency in ideological thinking can have a negative impact on society. It can lead to conflict and disharmony, and prevent people from working together towards shared goals. As such, it is important for people to be aware of their own ideological thinking, and to take steps to ensure that their thinking is consistent with their values and beliefs."}

{"id": "koala_48", "prompt": "who was the black cabinet member who went on to play an important role in the civil rights movement", "answer": "Martin Luther King Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister, activist, humanitarian, and leader in the African-American Civil Rights Movement. He is best known for his role in the advancement of civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience based on his Christian beliefs. King became a civil rights activist early in his career. He led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957, serving as its first president. With the SCLC, King led an unsuccessful struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia, in 1962, and organized nonviolent protests in Birmingham, Alabama, that attracted national attention following television news coverage of the brutality inflicted on black protesters by police. King also helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. There, he established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history. He also established his reputation as a prominent leader in the civil rights movement and he was soon being referred to as \"The Martin Luther King Jr. of the movement.\"\n\nKing's efforts led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He also played a key role in the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. There, he established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history. He also established his reputation as a prominent leader in the civil rights movement and he was soon being referred to as \"The Martin Luther King Jr. of the movement.\"\n\nIn 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to end racial segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other non-violent means. By the end of the 1960s, King had refocused his efforts on ending poverty and stopping the Vietnam War. He was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities. Along with A. Philip Randolph, Chavez, and Mahatma Gandhi, King is considered one of the architects of the nonviolent movement for civil rights and freedom. King is also considered an advocate for civil rights, human rights, and social justice.\n\nHe was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "  program."}

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees.

{"id": "koala_63", "prompt": "Is online casino legal in India?", "answer": "\n\nThe Indian government has taken steps to stop online gambling in the country. However, there are still some legitimate options for playing casino games online in India.\n\nThe Interstate Gaming Act of 2007 made it illegal to gamble online for real money in India. The act was passed as a result of the Indian Supreme Court's ruling in the State of Karnataka vs. the Union of India case, where the court said that the online gambling industry violated the country's constitution.\n\nThe government also passed the Information Technology Amendment Act in 2008, which added Section 66A to the country's IT Act. The section made it illegal for people to send text messages or post comments online that are \"grossly offensive\", \"menacing\", or \"defamatory\". This law also made it illegal to play online casino games for real money, as the Indian government considers online gambling to be a violation of the country's IT Act.\n\nThe government has also taken legal action against online gambling companies. In 2011, India's government shut down 151 online gambling websites that were offering real-money online casino games, poker, and sports betting to Indian players.\n\nThere are still some online casinos that accept Indian players without violating the country's laws. For example, the online casino licensed in Curacao is owned by Slotland Entertainment, which is an offshore company that does not violate the country's laws. Indian players can also play online casino games at the Bovada Casino, which is licensed in the United States and does not violate India's laws."}

It has allowed me to travel to new and beautiful places, and has provided me with a creative outlet through which I can express my ideas and observations of the world around me. The process of taking a photograph is deeply personal, and I enjoy the challenge of capturing the perfect shot, whether it’s of a landscape, animal, or other subject. Photography has also taught me to appreciate the beauty of the world around me, and I’ve found that being more attentive to the details of my surroundings has helped me to become a more conscientious and mindful person.\n\nPhotography has also impacted my career path. In 2011, I worked as an archaeologist in Peru before transitioning to a career in finance. While working as a finance consultant in New York, I began taking photography classes in my free time. When I moved to San Francisco in 2016, I decided to pursue photography full-time, and I have been working as a professional photographer ever since. My photography has also opened up many opportunities for me, including the chance to travel to new cities and countries, and to meet and work with a variety of interesting people.\n\nPhotography has been an important part of my life for many years, and it continues to inspire and motivate me every day. I look forward to pursuing photography as a career and continuing to create beautiful images that capture the essence of the world around us."}

You are now a shareholder, and as a shareholder, you are entitled to certain rights and protections. The company is now obligated to treat you fairly, and in some cases, you can even vote on important issues, such as the composition of the Board of Directors.

{"id": "koala_82", "prompt": "Explain me the Finite Elemente Method", "answer": "The Finite Element Method or FEM is a numerical method for solving problems of solid mechanics. It is a powerful tool used in finite element analysis (FEA) to analyze stress and strain in structural members and internal stresses in parts subjected to complex loading conditions. It is frequently used in the analysis of structures and mechanical systems such as bridges, buildings, machinery, and vehicle components. The method is also used in the design of new products and structures, and in the evaluation of existing products and structures.\n\nThe Finite Element Method is based on dividing the problem domain into a finite number of elements. Each element is represented by a boundary polygon and a finite set of nodes that represent the degree of freedom (DoF) of the element. The FEA model is constructed by assembling a set of elements that represent the geometry and properties of the structure being analyzed. The model may be 2D or 3D depending on the problem. The FEA model is solved by iteratively applying loads to the model and solving for the resulting displacements at the nodes. Displacements are then used to calculate the stresses in the model. The displacement is then used to determine the response of the structure."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " of [dis of the, (d, [c, ((d, [s, [subject (f of a (of, of the, (h of (of of (of, (of of the of of of the of, of of the (s of (of (of (d of (of of (s of [[po (con of (b [d [(sa-th (b (f [(c (dis (In and (and, [in (b of (h of the of (p of, of [of, (of, of the, d of the, (for, and, [F, (in, of, and, and, (of, and of [of, of, of (of of, (of, of and, and, and, and of, of, and of, (c, and and, and and, and, your, and, and, and, (inter, and, and, and –, of (of of of of, of the of of, and of the, of (of, of the of of [and of (cou of of [((you of, of [subject of, of [c, [s, (de of (c, of (or of, of (of, (of of, [and, (in,[(in, (c, [of, (subject of (con (h (per of ((in, and, (inc in ((c of (and of (of (of (((in of the, ([subject, Fain ((C, (th, (f, [with the, [in (in of, (of of the (you (th, (sa ((h, (in, the (in (and, [of, you, (you [from, as, s, the, the and (you, you, (and, [[of-of: (of (to (:c [, (of, (of of, of (p, ((f, In In (j of ((d (th, ((or, (w in of, of ((of – (in of (b, (–or, inf (b, and (p (of;,(of of ((in of (of, (cor, (ink of (of of of of of (of of, of, of of their (p, them, or, [c, and, (p, the, (sp, of, of, of, and, of the sp (in, sp of “and (th of the (of, (in, and, ([-and, the, (th, (f, ([(cont (t (or (cont and of (in of, and (j, and (in, of trans of the of of, of of the of the of, of, of, or, s, trans, of, [and of (in of [of, of,, of -, of, (?, and, and,,? -–you, of (I of trans of e of of, of of trans,, t, of \"of of the of (con of of the of (about of (about of the of the s of the (per, the, and, or, (co, and, and, of (de, ro, (c,, a, lo, or, , and, the, of, of (of of (c of of the ( of of, (of,, (c,,, and, [of, of, of, of,,,, of, of, of, of, of, of the, and ,, (, (, b of, of, of, of, of, of of,, – of, of, of, of of, of, of,, or,, (,, (, and, F,,,, - (f, (se, of, of of of ( of of of of of ( of of, of of - of ( of ( of [ of ( of ( (, of of of of ( – (, ( of (,,,, (F of of of of of, of of of of of ( of, of of of of of, of (, of, of of of of of, of of, of, of ( and, of, of, of,,, of [, (, [po of of of [of of, of of of of of of of, of, of, of, of w and of, or of of, of, of of, (of of of, of, of, (and of,, of, - of ( of, \" of, of the of, of (th of of, of ( of of of, of, (* (,"}

{"id": "koala_96", "prompt": "assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual", "answer": "\nThe key to reacting less and responding more is to use a pause ritual. Before you respond to someone, take a moment to breathe and pause. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, focusing on the inhale and the exhale. This will help you slow down and process what you are feeling, rather than reacting to the situation in the moment.\n\nNext, notice your body and your breath. Are you feeling tense or stressed? What sensations are you feeling in your body? Are you experiencing any physical changes? Are you sweating, trembling, or feeling your heart race? Paying attention to what is happening in your body can help you become more aware of your emotions and how you are responding to a situation.\n\nOnce you have calmed down, you can use a pause ritual to respond to the situation. A pause ritual is a mindfulness technique that gives you a moment to reflect, think, and consider how you want to respond to a situation. You can use any type of ritual that works for you, such as taking a few deep breaths, closing your eyes, or focusing on your breathing. The key is to use a ritual that helps you to relax and slow down.\n\nOnce you have calmed down, you can take a moment to think about what you want to say or do. The goal is to use a pause, rather than a response, to help you make a more considered decision. The pause ritual gives you a moment to step back and think about the situation, rather than reacting in the moment.\n\nNext, take a moment to choose how you want to respond to the situation. Do you want to respond in a way that is assertive, collaborative, or non-confrontational? How do you want to communicate your feelings and needs to the other person? The key is to choose a response that respects the other person and their feelings, and that helps you to feel calm and in control of the situation. If the other person is not being respectful, it may be helpful to use an assertive response to let them know you will not tolerate their behavior.\n\nFinally, take a moment to say or do whatever you have decided is the most appropriate response. This could be telling the other person that you are upset, asking for an apology, explaining how you are feeling, or expressing what you need. The goal is to respond in a way that respects the other person and helps you to feel calm and in control of the situation.\n\nIf you find that you are still experiencing strong emotions, you may want to take a few more moments to relax and calm down. You can use a pause ritual, such as taking a few deep breaths, closing your eyes, or focusing on your breathing, to help you calm down and feel more in control of your emotions. If your emotions continue to escalate, it may be helpful to take a break from the situation and come back to it at a later time."}

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "Dear friend,\nThank you for your request and the very interesting question you have posed.\n\nI am very glad that you are inspired by the teachings of J Krishnamurti. I feel sure that your students will also be inspired by the beauty and depth of the insights into the human condition that Krishnamurti offers.\n\nMy own experience with aikido and Krishnamurti's teaching are similar to yours. When I first began to study aikido, I was very impressed with the art's combination of physical movement, spirituality and philosophical depth, and I was delighted to find that it also seemed to offer a number of similarities to Krishnamurti's teaching. I had already been interested in Buddhist philosophy and meditation, and I found that aikido provided a way of exploring those themes in a physical form that was very appealing to me.\n\nAs I have studied both aikido and Krishnamurti's teaching over the years, I have found that they have both deepened my understanding of how the two can be brought together, and I have also found that they have helped me to deepen my practice of both. In my experience, aikido can help us to discover how the body and the mind can be used in an integrated way to explore the questions that Krishnamurti poses, and Krishnamurti's teaching can help us to deepen our awareness and understanding of the movements, and thereby the spirit, of aikido.\n\nI would like to share with you some of the ways in which I have found that aikido and Krishnamurti's teaching can be brought together, and I would like to offer some suggestions for some ways in which they can be further explored. I hope that you find these suggestions helpful, and I would be very happy to hear from you with any further questions or comments.\n\n1. Krishnamurti's emphasis on the importance of experiencing and being present in the here and now (what he called \"truth\") provides an excellent context through which to explore and deepen our practice of aikido. The practice of aikido and the study of Krishnamurti's teaching can both help us to become more fully present in the here and now, and the exploration of how these two approaches can be brought together can help both the student and the teacher to deepen their experience and understanding of this important theme in both aikido and Krishnamurti's teaching.\n\n2. Krishnamurti's emphasis on the importance of being open to new insights and perspectives, and not accepting things simply because they are familiar or well-established, can also be an important theme for exploration in both aikido and Krishnamurti's teaching. In both aikido and Krishnamurti's teaching, there are many things that we already know and understand, and there are also many things that we still need to learn and understand. By exploring how our practice of aikido and our study of Krishnamurti's teaching can be brought together in a way that helps us to become more open to new insights and perspectives, we can both deepen our experience of both aikido and Krishnamurti's teaching.\n\n3. Krishnamurti's emphasis on the importance of freedom and non-attachment, and his call for us to be free from both external and internal conditioning, can also be an important theme for exploration in both aikido and Krishnamurti's teaching. When we begin to practice aikido, we often find ourselves becoming more aware of the many ways in which our daily lives are conditioned by external forces: by our family, friends, culture and society, and by our social and political environment. But we can also find that our aikido practice helps us to become more aware of the many ways in which we are also conditioned by our own thoughts, feelings and sensations, and by our own emotions and tendencies. Through the experience of moving and being moved in aikido, and through the study of the teachings of Krishnamurti, we can both deepen our understanding of how external and internal forces condition our lives, and we can also discover how we can free ourselves from both external and internal conditioning.\n\n4. Krishnamurti's emphasis on freedom and non-attachment can also help us to explore the many ways in which we become attached to concepts, ideas and images, and to discover how these attachments limit and condition our experience. One of the most fundamental aspects of the practice of aikido is to cultivate freedom and openness in our"}

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "A double pane window can be more energy efficient than a triple pane window, but the difference is not as great as one might expect. A single pane window can be more energy efficient than a double pane window, but this requires more insulation.\n\nFor example, assume a double pane window with a total thickness of 1 inch has an R-value of 5.1/inch = 25.2 and a single pane window has an R-value of 2.4/inch = 5.7. In this example, a single pane window (5.7) has a higher R-value than a double pane window (25.2).\n\nHowever, the double pane window has a smaller U-factor (0.34 W/m2K) than the single pane window (0.41 W/m2K). The lower U-factor of the double pane window means less heat flow through the window, which is the main reason that the double pane window is more energy efficient.\n\nIn summary, a double pane window with a higher R-value can be more energy efficient than a triple pane window, but not as much as one might expect. In contrast, a single pane window can be more energy efficient than a double pane window, but this requires more insulation."}

Include content from the agile manifesto.", "answer": "Once upon a time, two brothers named Mike and Joe were born. They grew up in the mountains of Colorado where they learned to ski. As children, they dreamed of becoming ski instructors and living in the mountains. When they grew up, they became ski instructors. They worked hard, but after a few years, they realized they didn't enjoy spending their lives in the cold mountains. They wanted to travel and explore the world. They wanted to help others live happier and healthier lives. They wanted to work with cutting-edge technology, and they wanted to work in the city. They knew their skills as ski instructors would only take them so far, and they needed to learn something new.\n\nMike and Joe read an article about Agile. They were fascinated by the idea of working in an environment that promoted creativity and collaboration. They knew they had the skills to help organizations implement Agile and become more productive, but they didn't know how to get started. They had never worked in an Agile environment before, and they didn't know anyone who had. They didn't know what the steps were, and they didn't know where to begin.\n\nMike and Joe decided to start their own company to help organizations become more Agile. They knew they needed to learn everything they could about Agile, and they knew they needed to learn about Agile coaching. They both loved skiing, so they decided to name their company Snow Agile. Mike and Joe spent the next few years learning and practicing Agile. They read books and took classes. They practiced Agile with their own teams and with the teams of their clients. They coached their clients' teams in Agile and helped them improve their Agile maturity. They learned from their experiences, and they learned from their clients' experiences.\n\nSnow Agile became well-known in the Agile community. People knew Mike and Joe were Agile experts, and organizations hired them to help them with their Agile transformations. Mike and Joe were excited about the work they were doing, and they were proud that their company was successful. They were passionate about helping teams become more Agile and about helping organizations become more productive. They were happy to be working in the city instead of living in the mountains, and they were happy to be working with cutting-edge technology. They were living the dream, and they were excited about the future.\n\nMike and Joe's company grew, and they hired more Agile coaches to help them with their work. They were now Agile experts, and they had become millionaires by leveraging the power of AI. Mike and Joe lived happy and healthy lives, and they worked with teams all over the world. They traveled to different countries, helped organizations become more productive, and helped teams become more Agile.

As Saint Augustine said, “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better. As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals.\n\nBoth African American and African cultures have a rich history of overcoming oppression and resistance. The first African slaves were brought to the United States in the 1600s, and they began to establish communities in the American South. After slavery was abolished in 1865, African Americans faced racial discrimination and segregation that severely limited their social and economic opportunities. African Americans fought back against racism throughout the civil rights movement, which resulted in important legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Meanwhile, African countries gained independence from colonial rule in the 1960s and 1970s, but they continued to face economic problems and civil unrest. African Americans and Africans have also faced similar challenges associated with immigration, such as language barriers and discrimination. However, both groups have also fostered strong communities that celebrate their heritage and culture, including music, dance, and food traditions.\n\nDespite their shared heritage, African American and African cultures have distinctive identities. African Americans are descended from enslaved Africans brought to the United States, while Africans are indigenous to the continent of Africa. African Americans have a long history in the United States, while Africans have only recently gained independence from colonial rule. Furthermore, African Americans have a unique culture that has been shaped by centuries of slavery and discrimination, while Africans have their own distinct cultural practices. While both groups have faced similar challenges, they have developed unique cultural practices and traditions to meet their needs. For example, African American and African cultures have distinctive music and dance traditions. African American music has been shaped by jazz, blues, and hip-hop, while African music includes genres like Afro-beat and reggae. Similarly, African American and African dance traditions have evolved to suit different needs and cultures. African American dances have roots in African and Caribbean traditions, while African dances tend to be celebratory and community-focused."}
{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It is a typed superset of JavaScript because it adds optional type declarations to JavaScript variables, functions, and objects. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript because the code that compiles to plain JavaScript can contain type declarations. TypeScript is a typed language because the type declarations act as type checks, which ensures that the code always compiles and executes correctly. The type declarations are optional because the TypeScript compiler will accept and compile code that does not have type declarations.\n\nTypeScript also adds optional type annotations to properties, methods, and functions. Type annotations are required when the variables, methods, and functions are used outside of the TypeScript environment. Type annotations are optional when the variables, methods, and functions are used inside of the TypeScript environment. TypeScript supports object-oriented programming by adding optional type annotations to classes, interfaces, and parameters. TypeScript also supports the creation of classes and interfaces. The TypeScript compiler can create and compile JavaScript files that contain classes and interfaces.\n\nTypeScript has many similarities with JavaScript, but it has several differences. The main difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is that TypeScript is a typed language, while JavaScript is not. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, but JavaScript is not a superset of TypeScript. Another difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is that TypeScript is a compiled language, while JavaScript is not. TypeScript uses the JavaScript engine to compile and execute JavaScript, which means that JavaScript files can contain TypeScript code.\n\nDuck typing is a programming paradigm that allows the creation of objects and classes in a dynamic and flexible way. Duck typing is used when it is not necessary to define the type of a variable or object. Duck typing is also known as dynamic typing or dynamic typing. Duck typing does not require type declarations or type annotations, which means that duck typing is a looser typing style than type-based typing.\n\nType-based typing requires type declarations and type annotations to identify and define the type of a variable, method, or function. Type-based typing is stricter and more restrictive than duck typing, because type-based typing requires type declarations and type annotations. Type-based typing uses strict type checking to identify and enforce the type of a variable, method, or function. Type-based typing enforces strict type checking, which means that the code must always be valid and always compile and execute correctly.\n\nDuck typing is based on the principle of duck typing, which states that an object is type-compatible with a variable when it can be treated as that variable. Duck typing is based on the principle of duck typing, which states that an object is type-compatible with a variable when it can be treated as that variable.

They have been used in aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment, but have been increasingly used in construction since the mid-1990s. Carbon fiber has been used in building construction for several decades, but it has only recently seen an increase in popularity.\n\nCarbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) is a composite material comprising carbon fibers embedded in a polymer matrix, such as epoxy, vinyl ester, or polyester. CFRP is a high-strength, lightweight, and durable material, making it a popular choice for reinforcement in building materials. CFRP has been used in building construction since the 1960s with the development of the lightweight and strong FRP panel. FRP panels, which are usually made of fiberglass, have been used in building construction for decades due to their low weight, durability, and fire resistance.\n\nIn the 1990s, CFRP became increasingly popular as a building material due to its high strength-to-weight ratio and lightweight properties. CFRP panels are often utilized in high-performance buildings, such as schools, offices, and museums, due to their strength and energy efficiency. CFRP is also increasingly being used in residential construction as the price of CFRP materials drops and the benefits of CFRP panels become more widely known."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is one of the most significant challenges of this generation, and it will impact virtually every aspect of our lives. It is already causing harm to people, communities, economies and our environment around the world, and it will continue to do so in the future. To address this threat, we need to act now and act together – both at the national and international levels. This is happening, but more is needed.\n\nLeaders from around the world came together at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21) to adopt the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate agreement. The Paris Agreement establishes a long-term global goal of keeping the rise in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change and to adapt to climate change. It sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to achieve sustainable development and low greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change.\n\nThe Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016, less than a year after it was adopted, establishing a new era of international cooperation on climate change. As of 16 November 2016, 111 countries representing 72 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions have signed the Agreement and 22 countries representing 41 per cent of global emissions have ratified it.\n\nTo achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the world must undergo a fundamental transformation of the global economy. This transformation must be guided by the principles and provisions of the Agreement, including the goal of low greenhouse gas emissions, climate resilience, and the capacity for nations to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\nThe Agreement also provides a clear roadmap for achieving this transformation and sets out a series of short, medium and long-term goals for the 2020s, 2030s and 2050s. It establishes a clear framework for all countries to strengthen their national climate plans and to increase ambition over time, and sets a new global emissions reduction target for the 2020s. It also provides a system to track progress and to ensure that nations are living up to their commitments to reduce emissions and strengthen climate resilience.\n\nThe Paris Agreement is a landmark achievement, but it is not enough to address the scale and urgency of the climate challenge. We need to step up our collective ambition and action – to meet the goals of the Agreement, to achieve long-term decarbonisation, and to build climate resilience. This will require deep changes across all sectors of society and will require all countries, both developed and developing, to transform their economies and societies in the coming years.\n\nThe Agreement is a global framework, but action to address climate change must be taken at all levels. National governments have the primary responsibility to lead, coordinate and implement climate change policies, and to set long-term national targets to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. This includes setting and implementing national climate plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).\n\nThe Agreement also recognises the role of sub-national, regional and local governments, as well as all sectors of society, in addressing climate change. This includes engaging in planning, implementation, and review of climate change policies. To support these efforts, the Agreement provides a platform for governments, businesses and other stakeholders to work together to enhance climate resilience, support clean, low-carbon growth, and mobilise climate finance for climate action.\n\nTo achieve the goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, countries have agreed to mobilize and make available $100 billion annually by 2020 to address climate change through mitigation and adaptation measures. This includes a commitment to increase this amount substantially in the future. The Agreement provides a framework for public and private finance to support climate action, including the establishment of a Green Climate Fund (GCF) and a Technology Mechanism to support climate action.\n\nThe Agreement also includes commitments to strengthen climate resilience and reduce the risk of loss and damage associated with"}

It causes tiny clumps of cells to form in the body’s tissues, most often in the lungs, lymph nodes, or liver. The exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but the disease tends to occur in places where the immune system is active, such as the lungs and lymph nodes. In the lungs, these clumps of cells are called granulomas, and they can lead to lung problems such as shortness of breath and coughing. Sarcoidosis can also cause other symptoms, such as eye problems, sores in the skin, and swelling of the liver or lymph nodes. This disease is rare, and most people with the condition have mild symptoms that may go away without treatment. In other cases, sarcoidosis can cause complications that can be treated. There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but there are treatments that can reduce symptoms and help manage the disease."}

{"id": "koala_168", "prompt": "write a chronology of important events related to ESG in 2022", "answer": "The year 2022 saw the growth of the ESG concept in the global economy. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant impact on the economy of the world, which has led to a growing interest in the ESG issue. Here is a chronology of the most important events in 2022 related to the ESG concept.\n\nJanuary - The United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the period 2015-2030, which included 17 goals and 169 specific targets. The SDGs, which are part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, aim to end poverty, improve health and education, and reduce inequalities and environmental impact. The SDGs are a set of universal goals and targets for sustainable development, adopted by 193 United Nations member states. The goals have a global character and are of great importance for the development of an ESG-driven economy.\n\nFebruary - The World Economic Forum published the Global Risks Report 2022, which showed the main risks in the world in 2022, including geopolitical tensions, the spread of infectious diseases, environmental disasters, natural disasters and cyberattacks. It is important to note that the key risks that are considered by the World Economic Forum are closely associated with the ESG concept - they are related to climate change, biodiversity, and the economy.\n\nMarch - The World Economic Forum published the Sustainable Development Impact Assessment (SDiA), according to which the global economy in 2022 will face a $ 24 trillion shortfall in meeting the SDG goals. This deficit will be caused by inadequate funding, climate change, and inadequate technology. The report notes that the global economy in 2022 will need $27.3 trillion in investment, while only $3.1 trillion will be invested. This $24 trillion shortfall will lead to a slowdown in the global economy, as well as an increase in unemployment, poverty and inequality. The report notes that the lack of investment in the economy will lead to a slowdown in global GDP growth from 2.3% in 2022 to 1.9% by 2030. In addition, the report notes that in 2022, 820 million people will be living in poverty, and 115 million more will be unemployed.\n\nApril - The United Nations announced the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals Fund (SDG Fund), which aims to promote the achievement of the SDGs by providing financial and technical support and building capacity in developing countries. The SDG Fund will be created by merging the funds of the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Office for Project Services, and the United Nations Environment Program. The SDG Fund will have an annual budget of $ 3.6 billion and will be implemented on a multi-year basis from 2021 to 2024.\n\nMay - The European Union and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) announced the creation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Fund, which will be implemented in 14 countries in the EU. The fund will provide grants, technical assistance and training in order to help these countries achieve the SDGs by 2030. The SDG Fund will be implemented under the \"Global Environment Facility\" program, which is financed by the European Union. The total volume of the program is $ 120 million.\n\nJune - The World Bank published the \"World Economic Update\" report, which showed the performance of the global economy in 2021 and forecast its development in 2022. The report notes that, despite the global economic recovery in 2021, the world economy will grow at an average of 2.2% in 2022, which is 0.4% less than in 2021. This will be the slowest rate of growth in the global economy since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The report notes that this slowdown in global economic growth is caused by a weakening of the global economy in 2021, as well as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global trade and geopolit"}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " ( of of of a of (of of a of (p of our and [it (.
