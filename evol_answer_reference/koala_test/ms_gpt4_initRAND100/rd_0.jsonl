TCP provides reliable end-to-end network communication by ensuring that packets are delivered in the correct order and that data is received without errors. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that establishes and maintains a connection between two devices before sending any data. Once a connection has been established, TCP uses a four-step process to transmit data:\n\n1. Service Request – The device initiates a connection request by sending a SYN packet to the destination device.\n\n2. Service Establishment – The destination device responds with a SYN/ACK packet and begins establishing the TCP connection.\n\n3. Data Transfer – The two devices exchange data and the data is delivered from the source to the destination device.\n\n4. Connection Termination – The connection is terminated when the source device sends a FIN packet to the destination device.\n\nThe TCP/IP model is one of the most widely used networking models in use today."}

{"id": "koala_6", "prompt": "Can you tell my a story about nuclear physics like dr Seuss?", "answer": "Well, I'm sure you've heard a lot about nuclear power plants. All nuclear power plants use atoms of uranium or plutonium to create heat and generate electricity. In fact, nuclear power is the largest source of electricity in the world, producing about 11% of the world's electricity. Nuclear power can be a clean source of energy, producing little or no greenhouse gas emissions, but it also has some risks.\n\nThere are two types of radioactive atoms: stable and unstable. Stable atoms are those that are stable enough that they don't change easily. Unstable atoms are those that are constantly changing and trying to reach a more stable state. These unstable atoms are called radioactive atoms. Unstable atoms are also called radioactive isotopes.\n\nRadioactive atoms are unstable because they have too many neutrons or too few neutrons. An atom with too many neutrons is called an isotope, and an atom with too few neutrons is called an isotope. For example, an atom with 20 protons and 20 neutrons is called carbon-12, while an atom with 14 protons and 16 neutrons is called carbon-14. Carbon-12 is stable, but carbon-14 is unstable and radioactive. Carbon-14 is called a radioactive isotope of carbon because it is constantly changing from carbon-12 to carbon-12.\n\nIn nuclear power plants, radioactive atoms are used to create heat and generate electricity. In nuclear fission power plants, radioactive atoms are used to create heat. In nuclear fusion power plants, radioactive atoms are used to generate electricity. In both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion power plants, radioactive atoms are used to create heat and generate electricity.\n\nIn nuclear fission power plants, radioactive atoms called uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are used to create heat. In a nuclear fission power plant, uranium-235 or plutonium-239 atoms are split or separated into smaller atoms, called fission fragments. In a nuclear fission power plant, the fission fragments are combined with atoms of oxygen. The oxygen and fission fragments combine to form water, which is heated and turns into steam. The steam is used to spin a turbine, which turns a generator to create electricity.\n\nIn nuclear fusion power plants, radioactive atoms called deuterium and tritium are used to generate electricity. In a nuclear fusion power plant, deuterium and tritium atoms are fused together to create helium, which is then used to spin a turbine, which turns a generator to create electricity."}

", "answer": "One day, Hildibrand Manderville decided to go for a walk into the nearby woods. As he was walking, he noticed a bright light in the distance. As he got closer, he noticed that the bright light was coming from a mystical tree of great and terrible power!\n\nAs Hildibrand approached the tree, he noticed that the light was emanating from a single branch on the tree and he decided to investigate. As he came closer, he noticed that the light was actually a ball of blue fire. The ball of fire suddenly shot out and hit Hildibrand in the face, knocking him to the ground!\n\nSuddenly, Hildibrand found himself in a strange place. He noticed that he was in a forest and that the sun was shining brightly onto the trees. He looked around and noticed that he was all alone in this strange and magical place.\n\nHildibrand looked up at the sky and noticed that a large rainbow was arching over the forest. He looked around and noticed that he was surrounded by a great number of strange creatures. He noticed that they were all different sizes and shapes, but they all seemed to be laughing and playing together.\n\nHe then noticed that there was a large, old man dressed in a white robe and wearing a long white beard. The old man was standing on a large rock in the center of the forest and he was staring directly at Hildibrand. The old man was smiling and he was waving at Hildibrand. Hildibrand waved back and the old man began to walk towards him.\n\nHildibrand was surprised by the old man's approach and he quickly stood up and ran away from him. Hildibrand tried to run as fast as he could, but he soon noticed that he was too slow and that the old man was gaining on him. Hildibrand began to panic and he stopped running and began to look around for something he could use to defend himself.\n\nSuddenly, Hildibrand noticed a large tree that was growing next to him. He quickly hid behind the tree and was relieved to notice that the old man had stopped and was standing in front of the tree instead.\n\nHildibrand peeked around the tree and noticed that the old man was still standing there, staring at him. The old man was smiling and he seemed to be waiting for something. Hildibrand saw that the old man was making strange hand gestures with his arms and he realized that the old man was actually performing some sort of magic.\n\nA few seconds later, the old man suddenly disappeared and Hildibrand was left standing alone in the forest. Hildibrand was confused and a little scared, so he decided to look around and see if he could find some sort of shelter.\n\nHildibrand looked around and noticed that there were some large rocks nearby. He quickly ran over and hid behind them. He waited there for a few minutes, and soon he noticed that the forest began to change around him. The trees began to change and the colors of the leaves began to change and the sky began to change as well.\n\nHildibrand was confused and he realized that something strange was happening. He then noticed that the rocks began to change as well and soon they were all the same color as the trees and the leaves. In a few seconds, the rocks began to change into a glowing blue light and Hildibrand found himself surrounded by a strange blue light.\n\nHildibrand was scared and he began to panic. He had no idea what was happening and he didn't know how to get out of this strange blue light. Hildibrand was about to give up when he realized that the blue light was slowly fading away and he was once again surrounded by darkness.\n\nSuddenly, Hildibrand heard a voice speaking to him. It was a deep, gravelly voice and it seemed to be speaking right next to him. Hildibrand turned around and noticed that the voice was coming from a large beast that was standing next to him.\n\nThe beast was tall and thin and it had a large, pointed nose and small, bright eyes. The beast was dressed in a long black cloak and it had long pointed ears and a long tail. The beast was also surrounded by a shimmering blue light and, at first, Hildibrand thought that the beast was also surrounded by the strange blue light.\n\nThe beast was smiling and he seemed to be happy to see Hildibrand.

Historically, women have been discriminated against and have therefore been prevented from pursuing careers in the film industry. This has been a major problem for a very long time, and the issue still persists today. In 2015, only 7% of directors in the top 200 highest-grossing films were women. This is a shockingly low percentage, and in my opinion, the film industry needs to start addressing the gender imbalance and encourage more women to work in the industry. I think it’s very important that more female voices are heard in the film industry, and I am working to increase awareness of this issue and make a positive change for the future.\n\nHow do you think the film industry can encourage more women to pursue a career in film-making?\n\nThere are a number of different ways that the film industry can encourage more women to pursue a career in film-making. It’s important to remove the barriers that prevent women from entering the industry, and to provide more opportunities for women to develop their careers, build their confidence and gain the necessary skills and experience to succeed. In recent years, there has been a greater focus on diversity in the film industry, and I think this is a positive step in the right direction. However, there is still a long way to go, and there is a need for more active measures to be taken to address the gender imbalance in the film industry.\n\nHow do you think the film industry can encourage more women to direct films?\n\nI think the film industry needs to do more to actively support female filmmakers and encourage more women to pursue a career as a director. There are a number of different ways that the industry can do this, including providing mentoring and training programs, offering internships and work experience, and increasing the visibility of female directors in the industry. It’s also important to provide female filmmakers with the same opportunities as their male counterparts, and to ensure that there are equal opportunities for men and women within the industry."}

Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships.

The lengths of the sides of these triangles, in turn, can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem. With this information, the distance between the two points can be determined by measuring the lengths of the sides of the triangles and calculating the sum of the squares of the lengths.\n\nThe LDM method can be used to measure distances that are up to 2,000 miles away, with a measurement accuracy of 2 to 20 feet.

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information.

Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager!

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": " [...]ice."}

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

The defendants claimed that they held a valid lease for the land and that the plaintiffs' complaint was time-barred. The court held that the plaintiffs were not barred by the statute of limitations and that the defendants held a valid lease for the land. In Smith v. Mill Company, the defendant, a lessor, claimed that the plaintiffs, lessees, had breached a clause in the lease agreement regarding the payment of mining taxes. The plaintiffs argued that the clause was not included in the lease agreement and that the lessor failed to pay the taxes. The court held that the lessor was required to pay the taxes and that the lessees still had the right to take the coal from the land. In Gartner v. Baker, the defendant, a lessee, claimed that the plaintiffs, lessors, had breached the terms of a lease agreement regarding the payment of mining taxes. The lessors claimed that the lease had expired and that the lessee had never paid any taxes. The court held that the lessee had the right to take the coal from the land and that the lessors had an obligation to pay the taxes."}

Calcium ions are released from the ER when they bind to intracellular receptors called receptor-operated calcium (ROC) channels. When these channels are activated, they open the ER membrane to allow calcium ions to flow into the cytoplasm. Many different cell types contain ROC channels, but the type of channel present in a particular cell type is determined by the type of receptor present on the cell surface."}

Innovation has a positive impact on the quality of life of all Australians, by improving our standards of living and driving progress in areas such as health, education, transport and the environment.\n\n3. Innovation helps to improve the Australian economy’s resilience to global economic and political developments, by helping it to adapt and respond to changing market conditions.\n\n4.

We present a comprehensive taxonomy of DeFi protocols along with a quantitative analysis of the size of their market capitalizations, number of active accounts, daily trading volumes, and number of unique assets and contracts. We discuss the key characteristics of the protocols and their applications, including the underlying technology, market structure, and associated risks. We highlight the different risk profiles associated with different types of DeFi protocols. Our findings show that DeFi protocols are growing rapidly and are already reaching significant scale in terms of market capitalization, number of active accounts, daily trading volumes, and the number of unique assets and contracts."}
{"id": "koala_73", "prompt": "How does money go from my pocket, through the stock market, and to support the business I've bought stock from?", "answer": "Money goes from your pocket to the stock market through a variety of financial transactions.\n\nThe financial transaction begins when you deposit money into your bank account. Your bank then sends money to a Federal Reserve Bank, which is the central bank of the United States. The Federal Reserve Bank uses this money to buy government stocks or bonds, or it lends the money to other banks.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve Bank lends money to other banks, it sets a target interest rate to help control the supply of money in the economy and to help protect the value of the dollar. The interest rate that the Federal Reserve Bank charges banks to borrow money is called the federal funds rate.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve Bank buys government stocks or bonds, it's called open market operations. The Federal Reserve Bank then uses the money it gets from selling bonds or other securities to buy stocks or bonds from other financial institutions. This financial transaction is similar to the one you make when you buy a stock.\n\nWhen you buy a stock, you give your money to a brokerage firm, which then sells the stock to you for more than it paid for the stock. For example, if the stock costs $10 per share, your brokerage firm might sell it to you for $11 per share. The brokerage firm then pays the difference, $1 per share, to the seller, which is usually a mutual fund or another investment company. The brokerage firm keeps the difference, $1 per share, as its profit or commission.\n\nYour brokerage firm then gives the stock to you, or to your stock account. You may buy stocks directly through a brokerage firm or through a stock trading platform such as E*Trade or Fidelity. You can also buy stocks through a mutual fund.

The findings are that there is no restricted diffusion, no acute hemorrhage. In layman's terms, it means that there is not any fluid or blood pooling in the brain, nor is there anything blocking the passage of fluid into or out of the brain tissue. There is a paucity of posterior periventricular white matter with ex vacuo dilatation of the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. This means that there is a deficiency of white matter in the back part of the brain, along with decreased space in the occipital horn of the lateral ventricles, which are the hollow chambers in the brain that contain cerebrospinal fluid. There is also moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral atrophy with concordant prominence of the ventricles. Atrophy is a decrease in size and structure of an organ or tissue, and this means that the ventricles and the brain are smaller than normal, which can be caused by a variety of things, including cerebral atrophy, which can be caused by a decrease in brain tissue due to diseases of the nervous system or other conditions. There is also mild scattered foci of increased FLAIR signal seen within the periventricular and subcortical white matter. FLAIR is an acronym for Fast Low Angle Shot Images, and it is used in MRI scans to measure the amount of fluid in and around the brain. It can be used to measure the amount of inflammation in the brain, and it can also measure the amount of white matter in the brain. The increased FLAIR signal in the brain indicates increased amounts of fluid and inflammation, which could indicate that there is a disease or injury that is causing inflammation and swelling in the brain. Expected flow voids are noted within the intracranial internal carotid, vertebral and basilar arteries. The cerebellopontine angles and internal auditory canals are unremarkable. The cerebellopontine angles are the area at the base of the skull where the three main cranial nerves leave the brain, and the internal auditory canal is the passageway that connects the outer ear to the inner ear. There are no abnormal enhancements, which means that there is no visible change in the brightness or intensity of the areas in the brain that were seen on the MRI scan. There is no mass effect, midline shift or extraaxial fluid collection, which means that the size and shape of the brain is normal, there is no obvious shift in the position of the brain, and there are no fluid collections outside of the brain. No abnormal enhancement is seen, which means that there are no visible changes in the brightness or intensity of the areas in the brain that were seen on the MRI scan.

{"id": "koala_77", "prompt": "What if people only valued and took pride in the things that were true about themselves?", "answer": "The first step in understanding this question is to ask ourselves: What do we value about ourselves? What do we take pride in? In my experience, we tend to value and take pride in things that are true about ourselves, so if people valued and took pride in the things that were true about them, they would feel a much deeper sense of satisfaction and self-worth.\n\nFor example, I value and take pride in the fact that I am kind, empathetic, and supportive of others. I value and take pride in the fact that I am intelligent, hardworking, and driven to achieve goals. I value and take pride in the fact that I am loyal, trustworthy, and honest with those that I care about. As you can see, these things are all true about me, and they are the things that I value about myself and take pride in.\n\nIn my experience, the things that we value about ourselves and take pride in are the things that we genuinely are and the things that we do that are consistent with our values and beliefs. They are the things that we are able to recognize as having value and are willing to invest in and commit to. They are the things that we can be proud of and feel good about.\n\nWhen we value and take pride in the things that are true about ourselves, we give ourselves the permission to be our true selves and act in ways that are aligned with our true selves. This allows us to feel a sense of self-worth and self-acceptance that is based on reality rather than illusions and false beliefs. When we value and take pride in the things that are true about ourselves, we can use them as a source of inspiration to achieve our goals and make positive changes in our lives.\n\nThings that we value and take pride in are also the things that we can be proud of and feel good about, which can lead to feelings of satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment. When we value and take pride in the things that are true about ourselves, we are more likely to make decisions and take actions that are consistent with these values and beliefs, which can help us to achieve our goals, fulfill our potential, and reach our full potential as human beings."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " and, [f, [you, and, and, [[ear, [se, [h and, [s [of of [(of and of (of, you of a of ((and of a of of -of of (of of [c of (of, of of (of of (of of (of, [in [[h and (f [inf, (s ([h ([[in [subject ([(s?[st [inf, (of (le, [t, and, [, and, and, of the and of [or, and, and, un (f ([f, and, [(con, the, and, (be of, of, and of [of, of, of, [and of [and, and and and, and, and, of a, [in, and, and, the, and, and, (t, and, and, and, and, and, and. and, [of, of (of of c, [of, of the of (of of, of the of of the of – of, [, (([d of [of, of [of, [po, [b of (information of – and, of the of of ((d, or of (and of, s, (you, (and of [In (for,(in, ((and, (h, [of, [through [(h, of (f, (l of (([(f of (F of (and (you ((G, [(g, [[you, [d (([ ([[In, (in, (of (, “[- [[(the, and the, (co, the, ([se, [s (In of the. and, the, or, (in ([of, (-j, [(and in, and, (the (in, (for (to, ((f, (c of (and of ((d, the-part, ([(C ((part of ([h, (((con, [ of (de of (of, (h of (h ((in, (sp (sp (you (p, (pop (re, (g (in, ((sp, (th of the of of of of of of (, of [of of of of, of a of of (, (c, - to, ((st (and, (t of, of of, and, and of, of and, of the, n, of the.

They are added after the boil, usually 30 minutes to 2 hours before the end, to extract the desired flavors and aromas. The bittering hops give the beer its bitterness and create a balance with the sweetness of the malt. There are many different varieties of hops, each with different flavor and aroma profiles. Hops can be added in several different ways, but the most common is to add them as whole flower (whole hops), which is most commonly done when brewing all-grain beers. Hops can also be added as pellets, which are ground up hops, or as extract, which is a concentrate of hops."}

{"id": "koala_89", "prompt": "what are five important topics for game design", "answer": "In order to develop a great video game, the designer must consider five important topics. These include the following:\n\n 1. Challenge: The main goal of any game should be to provide the player with a challenge. This can be accomplished by creating an environment that is filled with obstacles or enemies. The player must work through each obstacle or enemy in order to achieve their goal. By providing the player with this challenge, they will be more likely to continue playing the game and will want to see how they can improve their skills.\n\n 2. Story: The story of the game is another important topic for game design. It will provide the player with a sense of purpose and will help them to become more fully immersed in the game. The story should include a clear goal that motivates the player to continue playing. It can also include a cast of characters who interact with the player and provide them with guidance and support. This will help to make the story more engaging and entertaining for the player.\n\n 3. Graphics: The graphics used in a video game can also play a key role in its design. The graphics should be clear and vibrant, and they should be tailored to the setting and theme of the game. This will help to make the game more visually appealing and will make it easier for the player to become fully immersed in the game world. It will also help to make the game more realistic and believable, which will improve the player's experience.\n\n 4. Gameplay: The gameplay is another important topic for game design. It should allow the player to feel like they are truly in control of the game and will help them to feel more engaged with the game. By providing a variety of different gameplay mechanics, the designer can ensure that the player will always feel like they are achieving something new and exciting. The gameplay should also be challenging enough to encourage the player to practice and improve their skills. This will help to make the game more enjoyable and will keep the player coming back for more.\n\n 5. Replayability: A game can also be improved with replayability. This refers to the ability for the player to return to the game and continue playing it after they have completed it. There are several different ways to improve replayability in a video game. These include the following:\n\n* Allowing the player to unlock new content and expand the game world\n* Offering new challenges that can be tackled once the main quest has been completed\n* Allowing the player to earn more powerful upgrades or new skills that can be used to improve their gameplay"}

{"id": "koala_96", "prompt": "assume the persona of a therapist and walk me through how to be less reactive and use a pause ritual", "answer": "A pause ritual is a simple yet powerful tool to help you cope with a stressful situation and prevent reactions or outbursts that can cause even more harm. The key is to use the pause ritual before you respond to a stressful situation and before you react to someone else's behavior. The pause ritual gives you time to step back and think about your response, which can help prevent you from reacting in ways that you may later regret.\n\n1. Before responding to someone, pause for a few seconds. This gives you time to think about how you want to respond. Pausing can also help you identify the source of your stress and better understand the person with whom you are interacting or the situation you are facing.\n\n2. Imagine that you are standing outside of yourself. This step helps you detach from the situation and prevents you from reacting emotionally. It also gives you an opportunity to assess the situation and consider how you want to respond.\n\n3. Ask yourself, \"What do I want to achieve in this interaction?\" This question will help you focus on the outcomes you want to achieve and guide you toward a more constructive response.\n\n4. Take a few deep breaths. This will help you calm down and stay focused on the situation. Deep breathing is a simple yet powerful strategy that can help you manage stress.\n\n5. Ask yourself, \"What is the other person's perspective?\" This step will help you better understand the other person's point of view and see the situation from their perspective. This step can also help you communicate in a more understanding and empathetic manner."}

Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent. With Accurat we bridge the gap between insights &amp;amp; actions by making sure you can improve and evaluate your door-to-door and your (digital) out of home planning targeting the most relevant audiences.''\n\nPlease think of the person judging the application.

Even when an individual or group of individuals is brought to justice, punishment is not always imposed, and in some cases, the perpetrators may be set free. This is due to the fact that the laws in place to prevent and prosecute war crimes are not always effectively enforced, and in the worst cases, they are completely ignored. This is because there are no absolute international laws in place that clearly define what constitutes a war crime, and there are also no consequences or sanctions provided for the violation of these laws."}

", "answer": " 1. What factors in an area contribute to a high rate of crime? \n\nA high rate of crime can be defined in many ways, but generally it means there have been more incidents of crime in a given area than would be expected. The factors that contribute to a high rate of crime are numerous and can depend on a number of variables. However, certain factors, such as poverty, unemployment, and income inequality are often cited as major contributors to high levels of crime.\n\n2. How does the rate of crime vary across the United States? \n\nThe rate of crime in the United States varies depending on a number of factors, such as population density, poverty, unemployment, and income inequality. However, the rate of crime is generally higher in urban areas than in suburban and rural areas because there are more people and more opportunities for crime to occur.\n\n3. What role does housing play in the incidence of crime? \n\nA number of studies have shown a correlation between the quality of housing in an area and the rate of crime. Some research suggests that housing conditions, such as overcrowding, poor maintenance, and the presence of pests, can increase the likelihood of crime. However, the evidence is mixed and there are many other factors that can affect crime rates, including income, employment, and education."}

It is estimated to cost $7 billion and would transport approximately 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day. \n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline has been a controversial issue in the United States for several years. The controversy surrounds the question of whether or not the pipeline is in the best interest of the economy and the environment. \n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline would connect Canada's vast oil sands production to refineries on the Gulf Coast of the United States.\n\nSupporters of the pipeline argue that it would create jobs, stimulate the economy, and reduce the United States' dependency on foreign oil. They also argue that the pipeline would improve energy security and decrease the nation's carbon footprint.\n\nOpponents of the pipeline argue that it would cause significant environmental damage, including the pollution of groundwater, soil contamination, and the destruction of wildlife habitat. They believe that the environmental impact of the pipeline would outweigh any economic benefits. They also argue that the pipeline would adversely affect the climate by encouraging more oil production, expanding the already-threatened Canadian tar sands, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn November 2015, the United States Department of State released an environmental impact statement that concluded the proposed pipeline would pose a minimal risk to the environment and would have little impact on climate change. The statement was released as part of the State Department's evaluation of the project for President Obama. In December 2015, the President issued a statement that he would make the final decision on the Keystone XL pipeline in January 2016.\n\nIn January 2016, the Obama administration announced that it would block the Keystone XL pipeline, citing concerns over the impact on the environment and the impact on the climate. President Obama said his decision was based on the State Department's environmental impact statement, which found that the pipeline would have a minimal impact on the environment. He also said his decision was based on the fact that the pipeline would not address the root causes of climate change.\n\nWhile the Keystone XL pipeline was a controversial issue in the United States for several years, President Obama's decision to block the project marked the end of a political battle that spanned several administrations."}

Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds.", "answer": "The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument that, given our current knowledge of the universe and the laws of physics, quantifies the likelihood of extraterrestrial life existing in our galaxy. It was first proposed by Frank Drake in 1961, and seeks to answer the question: \"How many planets like the Earth are there in the galaxy?\"\n\nThe Drake equation is often used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), but is also used to discuss the factors that may limit the existence of life elsewhere in the universe.\n\nThe Drake equation has seven terms, each of which has an associated parameter. Each term represents a factor that, when multiplied together, gives an estimate of the number of planets with life in our galaxy:\n\n\\[N = R_{*}\\cdot f_{p}\\cdot f_{e}\\cdot f_{\\oplus}\\cdot f_{i}\\cdot f_{c}\\cdot L\\]\n\nThe parameters and their corresponding values are:\n\nR* = Star formation rate in our galaxy per year. This parameter represents the rate at which stars form in our galaxy. A higher R* means there are more stars in our galaxy, which increases the probability of life forming on some of them.\n\nfp = Fraction of stars that have planets. This parameter represents the fraction of stars in our galaxy that have planets. A higher fp means there are more stars with planets in our galaxy, which increases the probability of life forming on some of them.\n\nfe = Fraction of planets that can support life. This parameter represents the fraction of planets in the galaxy that are able to support life. A higher fe means there are more planets with the potential to support life in our galaxy, which increases the probability of life forming on some of them.\n\nfo = Fraction of planets on which life actually arises. This parameter represents the fraction of planets in the galaxy that actually go on to develop life. A higher fo means there are more planets with life in our galaxy, which increases the probability of life forming on some of them.\n\nfi = Fraction of planets on which intelligent life evolves. This parameter represents the fraction of planets in the galaxy that actually develop intelligent life. A higher fi means there are more planets with intelligent life in our galaxy, which increases the probability of life forming on some of them.\n\nfc = Fraction of planets on which intelligent life develops civilizations that are detectable via a radio signal. This parameter represents the fraction of planets in the galaxy on which intelligent life develops a civilization that can be detected via a radio signal. A higher fc means there are more planets with civilizations in our galaxy that can be detected via a radio signal, which increases the probability of finding intelligent life in our galaxy.\n\nL = The length of time that a civilization is able to send signals into space. This parameter represents the length of time a civilization is able to send signals into space. A longer L means there are more civilizations in our galaxy that can be detected via a radio signal, which increases the probability of finding intelligent life in our galaxy.\n\nThe Drake equation can be rearranged to give an estimate for the number of planets with life in our galaxy:\n\n\\[N = R_{*}\\cdot f_{p}\\cdot f_{e}\\cdot f_{\\oplus}\\cdot f_{i}\\cdot f_{c}\\cdot L\\cdot (1-f_{o})\\cdot (1-f_{fc})\\]\n\nThe overall result is a probability that there is life in our galaxy, which is represented by:\n\n\\[P = \\left[R_{*}\\cdot f_{p}\\cdot f_{e}\\cdot f_{\\oplus}\\cdot f_{i}\\cdot f_{c}\\cdot L\\cdot (1-f_{o})\\cdot (1-f_{fc})\\right] \\times 100\\%\\]\n\nThe result is an estimate of the probability of life existing in our galaxy, which is 100% × 0.732 ± 0.289. This means the probability of life existing in our galaxy is approximately 73%."}

will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

{"id": "koala_149", "prompt": "How does Kahane's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon and Zizek when discussing to the American Jewish Establishment?", "answer": "Kahan's ethics of violence echo that of Fanon in that both reject the idea that there is a \"correct\" way to deal with racism. As Fanon points out, \"a Negro who, to maintain his human dignity, kills a white man is not a criminal, but an insurgent, a man of honor, and a man of courage.\" For Kahane, the idea that the American Jewish establishment should maintain their \"dignity\" by not responding violently to racism is a sign of weakness. Rather than remaining silent out of a desire to maintain their \"dignity\", Kahane suggested that American Jews take up arms and fight back against the racism they face.\n\nThe ethics of violence echo that of Zizek in the sense that both oppose pacifism as a way of dealing with racism. Kahane believed that pacifism was a dangerous idea for American Jews to endorse, as it would make the Jewish community vulnerable to attack. Zizek shares a similar perspective, arguing that pacifism is a dangerous idea because it gives in to the logic of dominant ideologies which pathologize minority groups and cast them as violent and dangerous.\n\nOn a deeper level, the ethics of violence that Kahane and Fanon advocate for are similar in that they are both motivated by a desire to protect the \"dignity\" of minority groups. For Kahane, protecting the dignity of Jewish Americans meant fighting back against racism, while for Fanon, protecting the dignity of African Americans meant fighting back against white supremacy. Both of these philosophies reject the idea that minority groups should remain passive when faced with racism, and instead insist that they should fight back."}

", "answer": "\n\nThe book Upstream by Dan Heath discusses the four elements that affect behavior change. The book describes the elements as the “Urgency Cycle”, “The Rider”, “The Elephant”, and “The Path.”\n\nThe Urgency Cycle is a concept that describes how people react to urgent and important situations. The book states that the urgency cycle occurs in three stages:\n\n1.\tAlert: Something catches your attention.\n2.\tInterest: You start to think about the problem and consider the benefits of solving it.\n3.\tDesire: Your desire to solve the problem increases.\n\nThe Rider is the rational part of the brain that focuses on logic, reasoning, and planning. Heath states that the Rider can slow down or stop the urgency cycle by providing information and asking questions.\n\nThe Elephant is the emotional part of the brain. Heath explains that the Elephant guides behavior by using emotions to motivate and direct action. Emotions can be positive or negative and can influence behavior. The Rider and the Elephant can work in harmony when they have a clear understanding of each other’s motivations. Heath suggests that the Rider and the Elephant work together to create an effective urgency cycle.\n\nThe Path is a model that describes how to create a direct route from where you are now to where you want to go. The path can be straight or curved and can be created by small or big steps. Heath explains that the Path helps to guide behavior by providing a clear direction, which can help you achieve your goals."}

It has been used in the construction of buildings since the 1960s, when it was first used in the United States on the roof and sidewalls of the Astrodome in Houston, Texas. It was also used in the construction of the roof of the Pont de Normandie, which connects the cities of Le Havre and Honfleur in France.

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is a major threat to the environment and sustainable development. The effects of climate change include increased temperatures, rising sea levels and changes in precipitation patterns. These changes have far-reaching impacts on human health, ecosystems and food security. They also exacerbate existing social and economic challenges, such as poverty, water and food security, and the effects of natural disasters.\n\nThe good news is that we know what to do to effectively tackle climate change and mitigate its impacts. Many of the solutions are also economically beneficial. The challenge is to build the political will and momentum for transformative change on a global scale, and to accelerate the transition towards low-carbon and climate-resilient development.\n\nThe Paris Agreement adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015 is the most significant international agreement to date on climate change, and it provides a solid foundation for action. The accord recognizes the fundamental importance of low-carbon and climate-resilient development for the achievement of sustainable development and environmental protection. It includes a broad range of mitigation and adaptation actions and encourages countries to move towards low-carbon and climate-resilient economic growth. It also provides an effective framework for international cooperation to accelerate the global transition towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient future.\n\nThe Paris Agreement came into force in 2016 and has already received the support of 195 countries, accounting for 81 per cent of global emissions. The agreement is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, together with a range of partners, including other UN organizations, research institutions and non-governmental organizations, is working to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement."}
{"id": "koala_161", "prompt": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "answer": "A film is a more traditional form of storytelling. It's a carefully crafted piece of art that has been created to be shown to an audience at a set time and place. When you watch a film, you're not only watching the story unfold, but you're also experiencing the director's artistic vision and the actors' performances. Watching a film requires a greater level of attention and focus than watching a TV series, and it can be difficult to fully engage in a film that's longer than 90 minutes.\n\nTV series, on the other hand, are episodic, meaning that each episode is a complete story on its own, and they're usually between 30 and 60 minutes in length. This makes it much easier to watch several episodes back to back. You can easily lose the thread of a film if you have to take a break to go to the bathroom or get a snack, but you're less likely to do this when you're watching a TV series, because each episode is self-contained.\n\nThe length of a TV series can also be a factor. Shows like Game of Thrones, which are based on novels, tend to have a slower pace than other series, which may make it more difficult to keep watching if you only have a short amount of time to devote to it. A 3-hour film like The Godfather or Gone With the Wind, on the other hand, is a great choice if you have the time to dedicate to it."}

Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.\n\nIf you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?\n\nFor example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: \"You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans\" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.", "answer": "There are three main motifs that are present in this story: 1. the American Dream/disillusionment, 2. the search for one's identity, and 3. the search for a better life.\n\nA motif is a recurring theme or image, and it's typically used to convey a specific message. In \"Jumping Monkey Hill\", the American Dream is a recurring theme that is explored through several motifs, including the search for one's identity and the search for a better life.\n\nThe American Dream is a common theme in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's works and it can be defined as the idea that all people have an equal opportunity to achieve success and prosperity through hard work, determination and diligence. While this ideology may hold true for some people, the reality is that for many, the American Dream is nothing more than a myth or a fantasy that they believe to be true, but in reality, it's just an unattainable goal that can never truly be reached. This is evident in the story when the Nigerian man who immigrates to America states that \"Your uncle told you: if you work hard enough, you can get your own house. In America, they say, you can even get your own car. They will give you a big bank account and a million dollars. If you work hard enough, if you are a good person, you can have the American Dream\" (Adichie 112). However, while he is initially hopeful and optimistic about achieving the American Dream, he soon realizes that it's nothing more than a pipe dream because he soon finds himself working two jobs just to make ends meet. He even mentions that \"Your uncle told you: if you work hard enough, you can get your own house. In America, they say, you can even get your own car. They will give you a big bank account and a million dollars. If you work hard enough, if you are a good person, you can have the American Dream\" (Adichie 112). However, while he is initially hopeful and optimistic about achieving the American Dream, he soon realizes that it's nothing more than a pipe dream because he soon finds himself working two jobs just to make ends meet. He even mentions that he has to \"carry two paychecks in his wallet, one from the gas station, where he worked in the night, and the other from the office, where he worked in the day\" (Adichie 112). This suggests that despite his hard work, he is unable to achieve the American Dream because he is not only forced to work two jobs, but he also lives paycheck to paycheck and is unable to save any money, which prevents him from buying his own house or car. Furthermore, the story reveals that while the idea of the American Dream might hold true for some people, for others, it's nothing more than a false illusion, a pipe dream, and a myth that they believe to be true, but it's actually impossible to achieve because it's not realistic. This is evident in the story when the man states that \"Your uncle told you: If you work hard enough, you can get your own house. In America, they say, you can even get your own car.

Metallic elements exhibit a wide range of physical and chemical properties including color, luster, and reactivity. These properties are mainly determined by the electronic configuration of the atoms in the material. For example, the elements found in metallic elements are usually found at the top of the periodic table because of their relatively large atomic numbers. The higher the atomic number, the more electrons the atom has and therefore the greater the number of electrons available for the formation of chemical bonds.

{"id": "koala_169", "prompt": "Is it rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence?", "answer": " Yes, it is rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence. It is rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence because people believe things for a variety of reasons, some of which have nothing to do with evidence. For example, one might believe something because they have faith in it, because they feel like it is true, or because they want to believe it. While it is rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence, it does not necessarily follow that one should believe things for which there is no objective evidence. For example, one might believe the Earth is flat, even though there is evidence that it is round, because one wants to believe it is flat. While it may be rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence, it may not be wise. For example, one might believe that their favorite sports team will win a game, even though the team has lost many games recently, because they want to believe it will win. While it may be rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence, it may not be rational to base important decisions on things that have no objective evidence. For example, one might base a major career decision on the belief that they are attractive, even though there is no objective evidence that they are attractive, because they want to believe that they are attractive. While it may be rational to believe things for which there is no objective evidence, it may not be rational to base important decisions on things that have no objective evidence."}

Some of these include:\n\n1. Organizing Shabbat dinners at home: A Shabbat dinner at home can provide an opportunity for Jewish families to gather together and engage in a relaxing and meaningful celebration of Shabbat. Shabbat dinners can be simple, casual, or elaborate, and can take place any time of the week or day. They can be hosted by the family or by a group of families or even the entire congregation. Shabbat dinner recipes can be found online or at local Jewish bookstores and can range from traditional kosher dishes to international cuisine.\n\n2. Lighting Shabbat candles: The lighting of Shabbat candles is a time-honored tradition that symbolizes the creation of the world. Candles are lit soon after sunset on Friday evening and remain lit for the duration of Shabbat. The candles can be lit by one person or by the entire family, and are traditionally placed in the windows of the home.\n\n3. Observing Shabbat with prayer and study: Shabbat services and Torah study can help reconnect synagogue members with their Jewish heritage and strengthen their Jewish identity. Congregants and their families can attend a Shabbat service at their synagogue, join a Shabbat study group, or engage in a personal study of Torah on their own."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " ( of [F [c of ((g of [h of a (g (S [[, ( ( ([–e [ and (( and – [n of ( and [( – of [h of a of a of of, of of of [of of, [of of [of of the of ([ (of (([([of ( (C and of people of (-se (, (c, - or (and and [h – of a of the of our, it and (of – ( and ( and, (s – of or – and ( of st, of ( of of of the of the of – of (,, our –,? – [m (s of the of of the of the ( of the of the of the of ( of an of (f of ( of (, of (h of (ve of of ( of the of (h of (and of (lo [([de of h (, and and and and of and of ( of the of h of of ( and of the of the of ( of of ( of ( of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of – - of,: - – of (( - of of of c of of of of of, of of, of of [of of and of - ((” in-of of or of in of of of of, of of of the of of of (ve of of of of in of of of of of of of of of that of of ( of - of [ [ of a of an of the of of of of of of of of ( of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of ( of (-d of the of of of of of of – of of ( of of [ of of of ( of the of of of of of of b of of ( of of the of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of people of ( ( (, of of [ of of of of of, of of the of of of of of of of [ of the of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of of of of of ( of of of of of of the of of the of (( – in [st and [ (f of [at and [ [st of [ and, [ of the of of of of and and of [ of of of – of c, and ( and and and, and of of the of a of the of of it- of the of the of -c ‘  s at, at ( ( [ of of ( of of.
