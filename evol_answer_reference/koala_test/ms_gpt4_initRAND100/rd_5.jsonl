{"id": "koala_4", "prompt": "Why can't bank use cash as capital as a buffer for potential losses?", "answer": "Banks are regulated by government financial authorities, which require them to maintain a minimum amount of capital in order to provide financial stability and protect depositors' money in the event of a bank failure. This minimum capital requirement is referred to as the \"capital adequacy\" of a bank.\n\nIn order to determine the amount of capital a bank needs to have, regulators perform a comprehensive analysis of the bank's financial position, taking into account its risk exposure and the probability of suffering losses. This analysis typically involves calculating the bank's \"risk-weighted assets\" (RWA), which is the amount of capital needed to absorb potential losses. RWA is calculated by multiplying the face value of the bank's assets by a risk weight, which reflects the likelihood that the bank could suffer losses on those assets. For example, riskier assets, such as equity securities and commercial loans, are assigned higher risk weights than safer assets, such as cash or government bonds.\n\nBanks are required to maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio, which is the ratio of the bank's capital to its RWA. The capital adequacy ratio is commonly expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, and is typically required to be above a certain threshold, such as 8%, in order to be considered \"adequately capitalized\" by regulators. By maintaining a sufficient capital adequacy ratio, banks can absorb potential losses without having to reduce their lending activities or raise additional capital.\n\nThe capital adequacy ratio is determined using the bank's balance sheet, which is a detailed accounting of the bank's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Since cash is considered a liquid asset and is not subject to significant risk of loss, it is assigned a low risk weight and contributes little to a bank's RWA. Therefore, while cash can be used to absorb potential losses, it does not contribute to a bank's capital adequacy. As a result, banks are not allowed to use their cash as capital and must maintain a certain level of capital in the form of bank equity, such as common stock, to satisfy regulatory requirements."}

I am a female film director from India. My name is Ritu, and I have been making films for the last 10 years. I started my career as a cinematographer, and then moved on to become a director. I have directed 9 feature films so far, and I am currently working on my 10th project. My films have won many awards in India and abroad, and they have been screened in several countries and film festivals. I am a member of the International Collective of Female Film Directors, a non-profit organization that supports female directors in their careers and aims to empower them in the film industry.\n\nAs you can see, female film directors are still very few in number, and we face a lot of challenges in our careers. I think the main reason behind it is the fact that we are still fighting for equal rights in society. Women face discrimination and harassment in every field, and the film industry is no exception. There is a lot of misogyny and sexism in the film industry, and it creates many obstacles for female directors. In order to overcome these challenges, it is very important to have female role models, so that young girls can look up to them and be inspired. Unfortunately, there are very few female film directors in the world, and very few of them receive the recognition and support they deserve. I think it is very important to encourage and promote female film directors, so that they can make a positive impact on society and inspire the next generation of female filmmakers. I am hopeful that we will see a change in the future, and more and more women will join the film industry and make a difference.\n\nThat's all for now, and I hope you enjoyed our interview.

You are correct that carbohydrates, proteins and fats all have caloric value. However, it is true that carbohydrates and fats have more calories per gram than protein, but this is not the only factor that determines the caloric value of a given nutrient. The other important factors are the digestibility and the metabolic pathways through which the nutrient is processed in the body. Carbohydrates and fats are digested more easily and are more energy dense than protein, which is why they have more calories per gram. However, all three macronutrients are processed through different metabolic pathways in the body and used for different purposes, so their caloric values cannot be compared directly. Protein is used by the body to build and repair tissues, carbohydrates provide energy and fats help to regulate metabolism and provide energy.\n\nIn your example, 100 grams of protein, carbohydrates or fat would all have the same caloric value of 400 kCal, but a different number of calories would be released into the bloodstream when digested and absorbed by the body. In other words, the same amount of calories in protein or carbohydrates would provide more energy than the same amount of calories in fat, because the digestion and absorption of protein and carbohydrates requires more energy than that required for fat. Therefore, in your example, 100 grams of vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes would have the same caloric value as 100 grams of carbohydrates, but the calories released into the bloodstream would be less, since they would have to be absorbed by the body."}

Does your school utilize one of the models mentioned in Goode’s article?  (Tyler, Haba, Stake, Chronbach, CIPP) If not,how specifically does your school evaluate curriculum?  Is it effective?  Why or why not? \n\nResponse=  \n\nIn Thornton Township district 205 the curriculum evaluation is mostly driven by the teachers and evaluated yearly over the course of the summer with “summer content institutes” in teams that consist of content area teachers and administrators. The team works together to review the textbook resource and teacher created resources to ensure alignment to content goals and Common Core standards. The method of curriculum evaluation used by Thornton district 205 mostly resembles the “Tabba Model” (Goode, 2019).   \n\nI would say that this method is effective in theory however in practice not so much. Many teachers do not use the resources the teams create over the summers except the teachers on the team. There needs to be consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of effectiveness. To improve upon this, we would need curriculum teams consistently using the common unit structures and assessments and tracking of the data. With consistent data analysis, the curriculum's effectiveness can be determined and the decisions informed.  \n\n \n\n \n\nWorks Cited \n\nGoode, Kristen.  Curriculum Evaluation: Process and Models.

The model is based on the assumption that effective curriculum is aligned with content standards and that curriculum can be evaluated through its alignment with these standards. The model involves a team of teachers, content area specialists, and administrators who evaluate the curriculum in the form of textbooks and teacher created resources. The team meets over the summer to review the resources and ensure that the content and instructional strategies align with the standards. The team also creates a list of criteria for effective curriculum and uses these to evaluate the materials. The model is effective in that it promotes collaboration and a team approach to curriculum evaluation. However, it is not as effective in practice as it is in theory. The model requires consistent use of the materials and unit plans to create a true gauge of their effectiveness.

Instance segmentation is a type of semantic segmentation that uses a convolutional neural network to identify and label objects in an image. The accuracy of the segmentation is determined by the number and quality of the object boundaries the network is able to produce in the image.\n\nAP is an abbreviation for average precision, which is a metric used to measure the precision of object detection or instance segmentation results. It is calculated by taking the total number of correctly detected instances in the image and dividing it by the total number of objects in the image. The AP is a measure of the quality of the object boundaries produced by the network and can be used to evaluate its performance.\n\nTo improve the AP metrics with human knowledge, you can provide the network with more training data and labels. The network will learn from the training data and produce better results. It is also important to check the object boundaries produced by the network and provide feedback to help the network learn."}

{"id": "koala_31", "prompt": "proofread：Identity confusion and a personal identity crisis were the main challenges I faced in switching majors. I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.", "answer": "  . in in in in and in in in and  and and in more to in t and and in in in and in b in and and. and r. and - c in.. of the ad in.

{"id": "koala_33", "prompt": "Expand on the relation between inconsistency and ideological thinking", "answer": "Ideological thinking occurs when an individual adheres to a set of beliefs, principles, or values based on certain ideologies, often as a result of personal, political, or religious beliefs. Ideologies are systems of ideas that often reflect an individual or group's world view, and they typically involve a set of beliefs and principles that guide actions and behaviors. Ideological thinking is commonly associated with closed-mindedness and inflexibility, as individuals who adhere to a set of ideologies tend to be dogmatic and resistant to changing their beliefs or opinions.\n\nAccording to psychologists, ideological thinking is characterized by the tendency to view the world in black and white terms, to dismiss any evidence or arguments that contradict one's beliefs, and to see things in terms of right and wrong, good and bad. Additionally, individuals who hold ideological beliefs often find it difficult to adapt or compromise, and are prone to engaging in rationalization, denial, and selective reasoning in order to justify their beliefs or justify their actions.\n\nContrary to popular belief, ideological thinking is not inherently harmful or negative. In fact, ideologies can play an important role in shaping and influencing individuals' beliefs, behaviors, and actions. However, ideological thinking becomes problematic when it becomes rigid and inflexible, and individuals become unwilling or unable to question or challenge their beliefs or assumptions. This can lead to closed-mindedness, intolerance, and a lack of critical thinking, which can result in a limited understanding of the world and an inability to adapt to changing circumstances."}

{"id": "koala_36", "prompt": "What does Nassim Nicholas Taleb say about market efficiency?", "answer": "In his books, Taleb argues that financial markets are not efficient, and that the concept of efficient markets is flawed. He argues that financial markets can be highly inefficient and that prices are extremely volatile and susceptible to sudden and large changes. Additionally, he claims that there is no such thing as a \"random walk\" in financial markets, and that there are patterns and trends that can be exploited to make money.\n\nTaleb also explains that the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is based on two main assumptions:\n\n1. That all relevant information is already reflected in the market price. This assumption is based on the theory that rational investors will gather and analyze all available information about a security, leading to an accurate price. However, Taleb argues that the presence of \"noise traders\" and other factors (such as human psychology) can lead to inaccurate prices and the presence of market inefficiencies.\n\n2. That all investors act rationally and have access to the same information. This assumption is based on the idea that investors have the same preferences and make decisions based on logic and reason. However, Taleb explains that investors often make irrational decisions and are influenced by emotions and other factors. Additionally, some investors have access to more information than others, giving them an advantage and leading to market inefficiencies."}

They gained access to some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\n\nWhat Happened?\nOn late (PST) February 5, 2023, we became aware of a sophisticated phishing campaign that targeted Reddit employees. As in most phishing campaigns, the attacker sent out plausible-sounding prompts pointing employees to a website that cloned the behavior of our intranet gateway, in an attempt to steal credentials and second-factor tokens.\n\nAfter successfully obtaining a single employee’s credentials, the attacker gained access to some internal docs, code, as well as some internal dashboards and business systems. We show no indications of breach of our primary production systems (the parts of our stack that run Reddit and store the majority of our data).\n\nExposure included limited contact information for (currently hundreds of) company contacts and employees (current and former), as well as limited advertiser information. Based on several days of initial investigation by security, engineering, and data science (and friends!), we have no evidence to suggest that any of your non-public data has been accessed, or that Reddit’s information has been published or distributed online.\n\nHow Did We Respond?\nSoon after being phished, the affected employee self-reported, and the Security team responded quickly, removing the infiltrator’s access and commencing an internal investigation. Similar phishing attacks have been recently reported. We’re continuing to investigate and monitor the situation closely and working with our employees to fortify our security skills. As we all know, the human is often the weakest part of the security chain.\n\nOur goal is to fully understand and prevent future incidents of this nature, and we will use this post to provide any additional updates as we learn and can share more. So far, it also appears that many of the lessons we learned five years ago have continued to be useful.\n\nUser Account Protection\nSince we’re talking about security and safety, this is a good time to remind you how to protect your Reddit account. The most important (and simple) measure you can take is to set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) which adds an extra layer of security when you access your Reddit account. Learn how to enable 2FA in Reddit Help. And if you want to take it a step further, it’s always a good idea to update your password every couple of months – just make sure it’s strong and unique for greater protection.\n\nAlso: use a password manager! Besides providing great complicated passwords, they provide an extra layer of security by warning you before you use your password on a phishing site… because the domains won’t match!\n\n…AMA!\nThe team and I will stick around for the next few hours to try to answer questions. Since our investigation is still ongoing and this is about our security practices, we can’t necessarily answer everything in great detail, but we’ll do our best to live up to Default Open here.", "answer": "Thank you for your question. When it comes to our data, we take security very seriously. We've made significant investments in our security systems, including:\n\n– 2FA (two-factor authentication)\n– Secure password management\n– Encrypted internal communications\n– Intrusion detection and prevention\n– Backup and business continuity\n\nWe've also implemented several internal processes and systems to help us detect and respond to security incidents:\n\n– Security Observability and Response\n– Vulnerability Management\n– Incident Response Plan\n\nWe regularly test and assess our systems, and have responded to and mitigated past security incidents, including DDoS attacks, phishing attacks, and theft of user data.\n\nAs for how we responded to this specific incident, we had a rapid response, removing access and instituting an internal investigation. We've also been communicating with affected employees and providing security training and awareness.\n\nFinally, I'd also like to share some advice we give our employees to help them avoid phishing attacks:\n\n– Be skeptical and question any suspicious links or emails, even if they seem to come from a trusted source.\n– Never provide your credentials, including your Reddit account password, to anyone unless you're absolutely certain you can trust them."}

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on ‘Windows 12’, according to sources familiar with the company’s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows – possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don’t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn’t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some “AI” features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft’s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n“AI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,” Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft’s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn’t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD’s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, “are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive”.\n\n“It’s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that’s what we’re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,” he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD’s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see “significant” changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup — and that’s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere’s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we’re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology’s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It’s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn’t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It’s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: “Artificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n“Like these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal…, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.”\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay’s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called “delightful.”)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they’re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt’s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let’s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn’t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it’s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC’s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren’t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: “Who knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!” To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it’s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat’s one of Windows’ biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it’s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don’t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can’t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, “We really botched this.”\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called “Windows Vista Capable PCs,” that lacked many of the operating system’s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI’m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won’t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n", "answer": "\n\n\nSpectual/\nLullicular\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnificialise, and the \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nhttpsial and\n\n\n\n\nThe \n \n\nFulific, \n\n\n\n\nInical, using, an, a, 28, \n \n  in the  in a \n 20.\n  (repul and \n\n. \n  [   \n \n \n  \n\n\n  (  for  57 and a ,  \n\n \n \n.  \n. \n.   .  \n. \n    \n\n.   . . .   . - -   target  \n. \n\n:   W  \nW  ,\n\n\n  "}

{"id": "koala_54", "prompt": "Write an interesting and detailed backstory for my half-elf ranger character for Pathfinder. The backstory should be dark and mysterious in tone but without the usual cliches like \"raiders attacked the village\". Make it unique and interesting. Be creative.", "answer": "The birth of our ranger was not an ordinary one. It was a cold, winter night when an elf wandered into the small village of Riverbend. No one knew her origins or how she had ended up there, but many of the villagers welcomed her and offered her shelter for the night.\n\nThe next morning, the elf seemed to have vanished without a trace, but just as she was about to leave, an infant was laid on the elf's feet. The elf smiled and gently cradled the newborn in her arms, murmuring words of love and comfort to the child. Then, without another word, the elf turned and walked away.\n\nThe villagers were heartbroken that the elf had left without saying goodbye or explaining her sudden appearance. But they also felt a sense of hope and joy at the arrival of the baby, a gift from the mysterious elf.\n\nAs the years passed, the child grew into a beautiful young girl with long flowing hair and eyes the color of the ocean. She was strong, courageous, and cunning, and she loved the outdoors and the animals that lived there.\n\nHowever, the girl also had a dark side. She was moody and temperamental, and she often lashed out at those around her in a fit of rage. She also developed a deep hatred of humans, which was strange given that she had been raised by them.\n\nAs the girl grew older, she began to question her identity. Where was she from? Was she an elf or a human? And what was the story behind her birth?\n\nThe girl knew that her mother was an elf, but where had she come from? And how had she ended up in the human village?\n\nAfter years of searching, the girl finally learned the truth. Her mother was a high elf who had been exiled from her homeland for an unknown crime. She had fled to the human lands in search of a new life, but tragedy struck when a group of bandits attacked the village where she had settled. The high elf was killed in the raid, but she had managed to give birth to her daughter before she died. Then, in a final act of love and sacrifice, she had left the baby in the human village so that she could live.\n\nThe girl was heartbroken to learn the truth about her mother. She had always believed that she was an elf, but now she felt like she had been lied to. What was she, really? Was she a high elf or a human? And more importantly, who was her real mother?\n\nThe girl decided to set out on a journey to find the answers. She traveled across the lands, meeting new people and learning about the different cultures and creatures that lived there. She even had the opportunity to meet other elves, but she quickly realized that they were nothing like her. They were cold and distant, and they treated her with contempt. It was clear that she did not belong with them.\n\nOn her travels, the girl also met other humans, and she was surprised to discover that they were not so different from her. In fact, she felt a strong connection to them, and she began to develop a deep affection for the human race.\n\nIn time, the girl learned that she could never truly belong with the elves, but she also came to the realization that she did not belong with the humans, either. She was an outsider, born to two different worlds. And so, she decided to forge her own path, following the call of the wild and living her life as a ranger.\n\nAs an elf-human hybrid, the girl struggled to fit in with either of the races, but she could never deny her love for the natural world. She lived in harmony with the creatures around her, and she became a skilled tracker and hunter. She protected the forest from those who would destroy it, and she defended the weak from those who would harm them. She was a guardian of the wild, and she felt a deep connection to the land and the animals that lived there.\n\nThe girl's life was far from easy. She battled many hardships and faced many dangers, but she persevered because she had a purpose. She was an outcast, but she felt a sense of belonging in the wilderness. She was a ranger, and she would protect the forest to the very end."}

These assets are then sold to investors, who hope to earn a return on their investment by owning the asset and collecting any interest or dividends it may produce. When you buy stock in a company, you become an owner of that company and are entitled to a share of the company's profits, known as \"dividends.\" These dividends may be paid out on a quarterly or annual basis and the amount depends on the company's performance.\n\nInvestors buy and sell stocks on the stock market, which is an organized market where investors come together to buy and sell different financial assets. These markets are regulated, with rules and regulations designed to ensure fairness and protect investors. The most well-known stock market in the United States is the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, which is located in New York City and is the oldest stock exchange in the world. The NYSE is an electronic exchange, meaning that trades are done electronically rather than physically, and it lists the stocks of thousands of companies, including many of the largest and most well-known companies in the world."}

This increased energy usage leads to fatigue and tiredness.\n\nIn order to maintain a normal body temperature, the body must generate heat in response to cooler temperatures. This is done by shivering, which causes muscles to contract and release energy as heat. As the temperature increases, the body produces less heat in this way, and must rely more on sweating to dissipate heat and maintain a normal temperature. This leads to increased energy usage and fatigue. In addition, the increased blood flow to the skin in order to regulate temperature can lead to dizziness and fainting.\n\nWhen you are warm, your body temperature rises. In order to maintain a normal temperature, this rise in temperature must be reduced. This is done by sweating and evaporation, which causes the body to lose water and energy.

It is particularly useful for problems that involve non-linear forces or deformations, such as the behavior of solid or fluid materials subjected to high stress or strain.\n\nThe finite element method involves breaking up a problem into a set of smaller sub-problems, called finite elements, which can be solved using simple equations. These sub-problems are then combined to obtain the solution to the original problem. In order to solve a given problem using the finite element method, the first step is to define the geometry of the problem and the physical properties of the materials involved. Then, a Discretization process is used to convert the continuous problem into a set of discrete elements. These elements can then be solved using simple linear or non-linear equations. The solution of these equations is then combined to obtain the solution to the original problem.\n\nThe finite element method is widely used in the fields of engineering and applied science, and is particularly useful for problems involving stress and strain, heat transfer, fluid flow, and electromagnetic fields. It has been used to model and analyze a wide range of physical phenomena, such as the behavior of solids, structural components, and biological tissues. The finite element method has also found applications in numerous fields, including aerospace engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, biomechanics, and electrical engineering."}

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I’ll write on the board, and then we’ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I’d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, “How could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?” And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, “We affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.” So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it’s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we’ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it’s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Let’s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that’s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that’s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he’s done we’ll says, “Wow. That was a inspired performance. ” We don’t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we’re talking about inspiration in theology, we’re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God’s Word to be set forth. That’s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don’t know how many times I’ve heard people say to me, “I don’t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don’t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.” And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. “Have you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.” Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you’re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, “Can I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?” And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she’s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They’re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?” And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there’s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here’s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn’t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, “Is it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?” I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn’t be just. But he makes a hundred. He’s inerrant. But I know he’s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, “We need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I’m saying is, “Inerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.” To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, “How shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?” And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that’s what we’re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren’t inerrant? And if it has errors, it’s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it’s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that’s more neutral. I said it’s a shibboleth. J. ’” And people who weren’t Jewish couldn’t say “shibboleth.” They’d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren’t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. ” Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I’m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, “People really choke on inerrancy.” He said, “They’re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn’t meant by inerrancy, and it’s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it’s a good word historically, let’s stick with it.” And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they’re going to say you’re not academic, you’re not intelligent, you’re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you’re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that’s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, “They’re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren’t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That’s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible’s own definition of truth. The Bible’s inspired, it’s infallible. Well, let me back up, it’s inspired; therefore, it’s infallible. And, it’s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:", "answer": " of, [w of (h, h of the, (b, (j, and, (m, [character of of (of of, ( of the of of (in of of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of [of of 'of of ( of of of of of [ of of d of [ [of (?

In simple terms, it is a hyperlink that directs users to another webpage. Backlinks are important because they help search engines understand how relevant a website is to a specific topic. The more quality backlinks a website has, the higher it appears in search results. This is because search engines view backlinks as a vote of confidence for a page. If many trusted sites link to a page, it must be helpful and informative.\n\nTo build backlinks, you need to create content that people want to link to.

{"id": "koala_109", "prompt": "what are some basics of nutrition that i should be aware of", "answer": "There are many basic principles of nutrition that everyone should be aware of.\n\n1. Eat a Balanced Diet:\nEating a balanced and nutritious diet is essential for good health and maintaining a healthy weight. This means consuming a variety of foods from each of the major food groups in moderate amounts to get all the nutrients your body needs.\n\n2. Eat Plenty of Fruits and Vegetables: Fruits and vegetables are an important source of many nutrients, including vitamins and minerals, and antioxidants. They also contain fiber, which supports good digestive health and helps control blood sugar levels. The USDA recommends eating 2-3 cups of fruit and 2-3 cups of vegetables every day.\n\n3. Limit Sodium and Sugar: Sodium is a mineral that is found in salt, and it is an important nutrient for your body. However, most of the sodium we consume comes from processed foods, such as canned soups, packaged snacks, and fast foods. This excess sodium can increase blood pressure, leading to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. The American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day, or about a teaspoon of salt. Avoid sodium-containing foods such as processed meats, canned soups, and instant or packaged foods, and choose fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits instead.\n\n4. Drink Plenty of Water: Water is essential for good health and is required for many bodily functions, including regulating body temperature, removing waste, and carrying nutrients to cells. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men and women should consume 11 to 13 cups of fluids per day, including water, other beverages, and foods with high water content, such as fruits and vegetables. Drinking enough water can help keep you hydrated, which can improve your overall health and well-being.\n\n5. Limit Alcohol Consumption: Regularly drinking alcohol in excess can increase your risk for a number of health conditions, including liver damage, high blood pressure, and certain cancers. The American Heart Association recommends that women should limit alcohol consumption to no more than one drink per day, and men should drink no more than two drinks per day. A standard drink consists of 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is found in just one can of beer (12 ounces), one glass of wine (5 ounces), or one shot of liquor (1.5 ounces)."}

Whereas most companies today can already rely on solid customer data, it is hardly ever complete: brands have a hard time understanding on what their customers are doing beyond their brand, let alone beyond their category. In comes real-world behaviour understanding.\n\nCurrent practices to support decision making have multiple shortcomings. Accurat's real-world behaviour understanding solution deals with each of them: instead of declared responses, we rely on actual behaviour derived from carefully processing millions of coordinates a day; insights are not based on a sample of 1.000 respondents but based on 1 million+ users in the Benelux(and growing); in contrast with only national or regional insights, Accurat allows a deep dive on specific audiences, regions or even local situations; compared to a static picture delivered after weeks at best, we provide insights on a near-realtime basis.\n\nOn top of that, most data available today lacks actionability: you know your most fierce competitors as revealed by a market research survey, but you lack the actionability to target exactly those customers visiting your biggest opponent.

{"id": "koala_122", "prompt": "The sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometres. Write a formula that finds the distance between the sun and Earth. How many years will the eclipse last?", "answer": "The distance between the sun and the Earth is approximately 150 million kilometres, or 93 million miles.\n\nTo find the distance between the sun and the Earth, we can use the formula:\n\n\\(d = \\sqrt(R^2 + h^2)\\)\n\nWhere \\(d\\) is the distance between two objects, \\(R\\) is the radius of the larger object, and \\(h\\) is the height of the smaller object above the larger object. In this case, the radius of the Earth is approximately 6,371 kilometres, and the height of the sun above the Earth is negligible, so we can use the simplified formula:\n\n\\(d = \\sqrt(R^2 + h^2) \\approx 4.56 \\times 10^6 m = 4.56 \\times 10^6 \\text{ metres} = 4.56 \\times 10^6 \\text{ kilometres} = 4.56 \\times 10^4 \\text{ miles}\\)\n\nThe distance between the sun and the Earth is approximately 150 million kilometres, or 93 million miles.\n\nThe solar eclipse will last approximately 137 minutes, or 2 hours and 17 minutes."}

{"id": "koala_125", "prompt": "I am an aikido teacher and student of Tomita Seiji who is living in Belgium. I am inspired by the teaching of J Krishnamurti for many years now, and I wonder if there would be an aproach in teaching aikido based on the educational ideas Krishnamurti developed. Can you suggested some posibilities in a concise way?", "answer": "There are many ways to approach teaching aikido, based on your own approach and experience. One possibility is to introduce the basic philosophy and principles of aikido, and invite students to reflect on how they relate to their own life and experience. It's important for the teacher to be honest, authentic and open in sharing their own reflections and experience, and to create an open and non-judgmental space for the students to do the same.\n\nIn aikido, we learn how to deal with conflict or aggression through the principles of respect, harmony, and peaceful resolution. Aikido instructors can introduce these principles and invite students to reflect on how they relate to their own experience and life. For example, we might focus on the principles of respect, noticing how we develop respect for others and how we express respect towards them. We might reflect on how we give respect to ourselves, and how we express respect for ourselves, including our own physical and spiritual needs. We can explore how we relate to conflict or aggression, and how we respond to them.\n\nIt's also important for the teacher to be clear about the expectations and goals of the class, and to facilitate the students to achieve these goals. For example, the goal of aikido classes might be to develop self-confidence, self-esteem and mutual respect, or to improve physical and mental health. The teacher can invite students to reflect on how they can work on these goals in the class, through their practice and training.\n\nAs a teacher, I feel that it's important to share my own experience and reflections, and to create a space for students to share their own experience and insights. This can be done through group discussions, or in a one-on-one format. It's important for the teacher to be authentic and not to impose their own ideas or beliefs on the students. \n\nIn aikido, we learn how to protect ourselves without causing harm to others. This principle is based on the philosophy of non-violence, and can be related to principles such as compassion and respect for others. As a teacher, I can share my personal experience in working towards non-violence, and invite students to reflect on how they relate to this principle in their own lives. We can discuss the different forms of violence, and how we can work towards non-violence in our daily lives. We can also explore what it means to be compassionate towards others, and how we can practice compassion in our daily lives.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many ways to approach teaching aikido based on your own approach and experience. One possibility is to introduce the basic philosophy and principles of aikido, and invite students to reflect on how they relate to their own life and experience. It's important for the teacher to be honest, authentic and open in sharing their own reflections and experiences, and to create an open and non-judgmental space for the students to do the same."}

{"id": "koala_135", "prompt": "i assume you are familiar with the Drake equation. Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds.", "answer": "The Drake equation is a conditional probability formula that relates the number of active, communicative, and technologically-capable civilizations in the Milky Way to factors such as the average rate of star formation, fraction of stars with planetary systems, average number of planets per system that can support life, and so on. Since the equation is based on several factors that are not well understood and that have a wide range of possible values, it is difficult to estimate its exact result and associated error margins. A common approach is to calculate the value for a given range of possible values for each factor and then take the average or a weighted average of the results. This can help provide a more accurate estimate of the overall result, although it will still have a large associated uncertainty.\n\nUsing the standard values and assumptions for each factor in the Drake equation, the result for the number of potentially communicative civilizations in the Milky Way is 10^30, with an associated error of 10^23. This value corresponds to a probability of 0.01% that there is at least one such civilization within the Milky Way. This result is based on the assumption that the average rate of star formation in the galaxy is 10 stars per year, that 10% of stars harbor planetary systems, and that 10% of those systems have planets capable of supporting life."}

YouTube<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhB2qKcB1o<br><br>Transcript:<br>(00:00) when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring<br>(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

In countries with a warm climate, windows with one glass pane are replaced with windows with two glass panes. Where there is a cold winter, windows with two panes are replaced with windows with three panes. Qestions: can a double pane window be more efficient than a triple pane window? Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n", "answer": "\nTo answer your question, we need to determine the U-value of each window type. The U-value of a window is an indication of the amount of energy required to heat or cool a building through the window. A lower U-value means that the window allows less heat to escape, making it more energy efficient.\n\nIn colder climates, a double pane window is more efficient than a single pane window, as it has a lower U-value. For example, a single pane window has a U-value of 3.8 watts per square meter per degree Kelvin (W/m2·K), while a double pane window has a U-value of 2.6 W/m2·K. \n\nIn warmer climates, a double pane window is less efficient than a single pane window, as it has a higher U-value. For example, a single pane window has a U-value of 3.8 W/m2·K, while a double pane window has a U-value of 3.3 W/m2·K.\n\nIn summary, a single pane window is more efficient than a double pane window in colder climates, while a double pane window is more efficient than a single pane window in warmer climates."}

Fanon and Zizek are critical theorists, while Kahane is a political activist. Fanon and Zizek are concerned with the dehumanization of the colonized, while Kahane is concerned with the perceived threat to Jewish identity and survival. In their analyses, Fanon and Zizek argue that violence is necessary for decolonization and resistance, while Kahane argues that violence is necessary for the preservation and protection of Jewish identity and existence."}

{"id": "koala_155", "prompt": "explain TypeScript and Duck Typing", "answer": "TypeScript is a programming language that runs on top of JavaScript, and adds typing information to JavaScript statements. This means that TypeScript can help prevent runtime errors and also makes code easier to read and understand. In TypeScript, every variable and function is specified with a type, such as \"number\" or \"string\". This makes it possible for the TypeScript compiler to check the correctness and consistency of code. TypeScript has both static and dynamic typing, which means that it can perform type checking at compile time and also during runtime. This can help catch errors early in the development process, before they are introduced into the codebase.\n\nDuck typing is a programming language model that does not require the explicit specification of variable types. In duck typing, the type of a variable is determined by its behavior or by the properties it has. This means that if a variable behaves like a specific type, then it can be treated as that type, even if it isn't actually defined as that type. For example, if a variable holds an integer that can be added to another integer, then it can be treated as an integer. This makes it possible to dynamically adapt code to work with different types. Duck typing is useful in situations where the exact type of a variable is not known or is changing frequently. It is also useful for languages that do not have strict typing, such as JavaScript."}

{"id": "koala_160", "prompt": "how much of a threat is climate change in the coming years, and what should we do to stop it?", "answer": "Climate change is a global issue with serious implications for the future of human life and the planet. It is caused by the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The most significant factor contributing to climate change is the burning of fossil fuels, which releases CO2 into the atmosphere and warms the planet. The burning of fossil fuels for energy is responsible for more than 60% of global CO2 emissions. Other sources of CO2 emissions include deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes.\n\nClimate change threatens the world in many ways. It will cause sea levels to rise, leading to coastal flooding and the displacement of millions of people. It will affect global weather patterns, resulting in more extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes. It will also harm ecosystems, causing species extinction and threatening the survival of many plant and animal species.\n\nThere is still time to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. However, we must act quickly to limit global warming and reduce CO2 emissions. This can be done by adopting renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Individuals can also take steps to reduce their personal carbon footprint, such as using public transportation, walking or cycling instead of driving, eating local, seasonal food, recycling, and using energy-efficient appliances."}

{"id": "koala_177", "prompt": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n“I think sometimes we’re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n“Often the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,” he continues.\n“Slang as a sort of term that’s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n“We have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that’s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they’re really quite amazing things.”\n“It’s a potentially massive term,” says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n“One of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n“But then you’ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he’s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n“It’s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.”\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we’re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n“It’s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you’re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like ‘yer ma’, or ‘yer man’ and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don’t and can’t,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“There’s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there’s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n“Sometimes we might get anxious that we’re using cliches, but we’re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.”\nThink too of Line of Duty’s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn’t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n“That really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n“Sometimes we’ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.”\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n“I think it’s unfortunate that it’s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,” says Gail.\n“It’s so frustrating but I think there’s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n“And it’s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It’s one dimension of what slang can do.”\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n“In many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n“We have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n“We are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for ‘potatoes’ that we have.\n“Certain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that’s a real strength. I think there’s a variety there and there’s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don’t think we’ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.”\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a ‘boak’ after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done ‘the messages’? My favourite slang word ‘hoke’ has an Ulster Scots origin. It’s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n“Often there’s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it’s bad language, or it doesn’t have a sense of value behind it,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“But on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n“There are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it’s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you’re in the room.\n“Whenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns’ To a Mouse and ‘wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie’ appears in the first line.\n“This really electrifies him because the word ‘wee’ appears. It’s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it’s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n“I think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we’ve grown up with, we’re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there’s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don’t connect us.”\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we’re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland’s case, that we have multiple uses for the word ‘wee.’\n“We all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it’s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we’re foundered,” says Dr Ferguson.\n“One of our great words, and I think there’s a difference between the town and city where it’s ‘scunnered’ or ‘scundered’. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of ‘I am totally scunnered’ or ‘I am totally scundered’ about something. These are things that we should protect.”\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n“Yesterday’s slang term is today or the future’s commonly understood term for something,” she explains.\n“I guess that’s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You’re getting a people’s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n“Every year I’m always interested to see what makes it into the OED — it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n“In 2022, ‘a chara’ entered the OED. So did ‘fluthered’, first used by James Joyce in 1927, ‘gaslighter’ and ‘vaxxed’. It’s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we’re living through.”\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the ‘beauty’ of slang is that it’s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n“It often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,” he laughs.\n“But there’s a there’s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They’re used in some circles and in some groups.\n“We all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we’ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, ‘uni’ seems one of the obvious words to use because it’s been floating through media, but it’s loaded into everyday speech.\n“Language is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we’re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.”\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they’re widely available for visitors to enjoy — on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n“I think it’s actually gotten more popular,” she says of the slang-adorned items.\n“There’s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n“I think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.”\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we’re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom ‘up to high doh’ coasters to ‘a wee bag’ tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n“I knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast — 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,” explains Linzi.\n“With the Americans coming over and they ask, ‘What’s “awk hiya love?”’ – which we have on our socks and mugs – once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they’re running around America with a pair of ‘awk hiya love’ socks on with people asking, ‘What’s awk?’\n“It creates engagement in the shop and it’s probably why the shop is doing so well as it’s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n“It opens conversations which is brilliant.”\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with ‘alright big lad’ and customers still love ‘Ulster says yeooo!’ and ‘ats us nai’.\n“Having tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,” continues Linzi.\n“For the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere’s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.”\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n“I was always very conscious that it’s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it’s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it’s quite popular.\n“It may not want to be a mug you’d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their ‘alright’ sock in a style that’s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you’re able to tie those two together then you’ve got a good product. It’s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.”\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n“I’m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,” says Gail. “Simple things like I’ll say ‘plaster’ and she’ll say ‘Band-aid,’ I’ll say ‘chips’ and she’ll say ‘fries’. He knows that he’s betwixt and between terms.\n“Even things like ‘wee’ and ‘what’s the craic?’ There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who’s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, ‘Well, hello, what’s the craic?’ Or even words like ‘scundered’ or ‘jammy,’ or ‘dead on,’ all these things that I say quite often.”\"\n", "answer": " of ( of of of ( of in ne of ( un ( [ of a  ( ( ( B ( - [ ( C, har (: ( ( ( - ( ‘ – or – or, or ( of ( of, of of [ of of ( of of of, of of, of of of the of of of of of of of of or of the [ of of c [ of of ( ( of (, ( ( both, e ‘ - d or and, ( – of or of, of – of ( of, of of the – [ – and [ – in, (-t in – or, and of of ( of of of of of of of the of our or,, ( [ –  and of of the of our of- and of c of  of of of co of ( ( of of ( of (( of, of of ( of of of ( of of of the of of people – of people of of in m ( and ([ ( [ of and at ( and of ( of [ of of or of of of of of of of of or of of of of of of of of ( of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of and of, of or of of of of our of of of of and of of and of or of ( – of the in and of [; as ( of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of or of of of of if of of of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of an of of of of, of of  of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of, of of of of of of of of ( of ( of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of, of of of the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of C of of of of of [ of a of, and [ of [ [ [ [ [ ( [ of [ of ( [ [ C, [, or [ [ of it of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of – and and, and in and ( and of [  of and of of of of of of of of the of people ( of the and of N N ( as – ( of of – of [ of – of of- of of- of [ and - [( ( of ( [ of ( C [ ( [ ( and C ( ( but ( of C, [(, H-h ( s or( ( [ or – by h and,( ( of our ( of of ( ( of our ( H - ( or ( ( (, l and, ( ( ( of ( or of of of of of  of of of ( C A [ (- ( – – and, ( ( ( ( ( [ ( H [ ( ( ( in ( ( ( of ( ( or \" of of of of of of-s of ( [[ and ( [ of either ( of of of, of of of [ [- of of of as of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ – [ [[ and [  [ [ ( for ( of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of of [ of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of al of (t ( of, in-t or, g ( – ( ( ( or, of and of and h ( – of- ( ( or ( ( of [ ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of an of of P of,, C for [ for C ( of and of in of of of of of, of of and, ( [ of and of, of of ( of of ( of [ of ( of of of of of of of of of of of c of [ ( or and ( and for [ or of for ( of of of of of of of C of – of of of ( of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of ( of or of of of ( N, and, for, for in for, and and, in of, of in of of of [ of the of C of “ of the of, of of or of of of of [ of of of of as and of of or – [ of [ of of, of ( of of of of ( of- of ( of of of ( of ( of of C ( of of, ( and ( of of"}
