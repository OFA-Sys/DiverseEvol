{"question_id": 16, "text": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Gene editing is a process by which specific DNA sequences can be modified. CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology used for this purpose, which involves the use of two components, a guide RNA and a Cas9 enzyme. The guide RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific location in the DNA where it cuts the sequence and introduces a mutation. This mutation can be used to add, delete or replace a gene sequence, allowing for potential applications such as gene therapy, disease resistance and gene enhancement in agriculture. \n\nThe potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are vast, however, there are ethical considerations that must be taken into account. The ability to make precise changes to the human genome raises questions about the responsibility of scientists and the potential for abuse. In addition, while the technology is currently used for beneficial purposes, it is still a form of genetic modification, which carries risks of unknown long-term effects."}

The global economy would not have been disrupted by the discovery of new trade routes, and the exchange of ideas and cultures between Europe and the Americas would have been limited.
