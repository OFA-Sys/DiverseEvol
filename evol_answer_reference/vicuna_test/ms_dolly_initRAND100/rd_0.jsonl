Plant-based protein sources include soy, rice, pea, and hemp protein. These proteins are more easily digested than animal-based sources, and are easier to digest for those with gluten issues. Plant-based protein sources do not contain cholesterol and are lower in saturated fat, and higher in dietary fiber, potassium, magnesium, and iron. Plant-based protein sources are often more expensive than animal-based protein sources. Animal-based protein sources include whey, egg, and casein protein. These sources are rich in BCAAs (branched chain amino acids) and are generally considered to be slower digesting. Animal-based protein sources are higher in creatine, leucine, and other amino acids.

{"question_id": 10, "text": "What are the most effective strategies for conflict resolution in the workplace?", "category": "generic", "answer": "To be able to resolve disputes constructively, you should first understand your own personality type. We all have different personalities, and these personalities define the way we see the world. Different personalities react to situations differently. If you understand your own personality type, you will be able to understand which type of people you need to avoid when resolving conflicts and which people you need to utilize.\n\nFor example, if you are a type A personality, you probably enjoy working independently and solving problems on your own. Type B people, on the other hand, are more of the team-oriented type. They prefer to work with others when solving conflicts.\n\nType A people are known for their quick decisions, while type Bs prefer to weigh all the options before making a decision. Type A people also tend to be strong leaders, while type Bs prefer to work as a group. This explains why leaders should try to avoid type A people when resolving conflicts. Instead, they should utilize type B people, who are better at compromising."}

{"question_id": 16, "text": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing technology that is used for genome engineering. It is derived from bacterial adaptive immune systems that recognize and cut DNA at specific locations. The Cas9 endonuclease cleaves DNA at a fixed sequence known as a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). A DNA sequence called the gRNA is designed to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to a specific target DNA sequence. The genome editing tool is aided by a protein complex called Cas12a and the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to locate the target DNA sequence. The Cas12a endonuclease cuts both strands of DNA at the target site. The DNA repair system then repairs the cut DNA by filling in the cut ends with DNA from the same strand of the DNA. This process does not introduce new information into the genome, but only modifies the existing information. CRISPR-Cas9 uses an endogenous homologous repair system, which means that it does not alter the organism’s genome. The Cas9 endonuclease is designed to cut DNA at a precise location, usually at a G A U T, where G is guanine, A is adenine, U is uracil, and T is thymine. The gRNA is synthesized in vitro, and the guide strand is annealed to the Cas9 endonuclease to form Cas9–gRNA. The gRNA is then injected into the organism. The Cas9–gRNA complex binds to the target DNA, and Cas9 cleaves the DNA. It is possible to remove the DNA sequences that are desired to be deleted using a nuclease known as transcription activator-like effector nuclease. The DNA that is transcribed from the target promoter can be replaced with a different sequence. For example, it is possible to introduce a gene that codes for a fluorescent protein into a plant. After the genome editing process, the organism may be grown and observed for the fluorescence of the introduced protein. CRISPR-Cas9 is being widely used to engineer plants, animals, and microorganisms, and is a potential therapeutic tool for many diseases. Many therapeutic applications of CRISPR-Cas9 use the Cas9–gRNA complex to introduce the Cas9 endonuclease into cells. This can be used to replace defective genes with healthy genes or to delete cancer cells. CRISPR-Cas9 is not without ethical concerns. The technology can edit the genome of an individual in ways that can be passed on to future generations. CRISPR-Cas9 is also being used to edit the genome of embryos, which can be a controversial topic because it can lead to germline modification and permanent changes in the genome."}
{"question_id": 17, "text": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Most infections in humans are caused by bacteria and viruses. When an infection occurs, the immune system responds by producing antibodies. These antibodies are used to fight the infection and destroy the virus or bacteria. Once the infection is gone, the body's immune response will also diminish. However, an individual who is vaccinated will also develop antibodies against the disease. Vaccinations allow people to develop antibodies without being infected by the disease. Vaccines are a much safer way to prevent infections than trying to find and treat the disease. When a significant portion of a population is vaccinated against a disease, it can prevent some people from contracting the disease as well as help infected individuals from spreading the disease to other unvaccinated individuals. This is known as herd immunity and is a significant factor in preventing the spread of infectious diseases."}
{"question_id": 18, "text": "How do social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "While many news outlets have had to lay off journalists in recent years due to the transition of news consumption to social media platforms, social media still has the potential to drive greater public engagement with the news. Social media platforms have the ability to distribute information more widely, but they also have a more significant role in perpetuating misinformation, as they are often used as a platform to distribute misinformation. The proliferation of misinformation on social media has become so prevalent that the term \"fake news\" has been coined to describe this phenomenon. While social media platforms have attempted to combat misinformation by using fact-checking software, many have failed to do so effectively, and misinformation is still able to spread on social media platforms."}

{"question_id": 20, "text": "Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Natural selection is the process by which the better adapted organisms in a population will have a better chance to live and reproduce. This can be seen as a \"survival of the fittest\", whereby the traits of organisms that enable them to survive and reproduce (reproductive fitness) is passed down to the next generation. Because of this, the next generation will have a higher chance of inheriting these traits than the previous generation. As a result, each generation becomes better adapted to its environment, and the process repeats. Natural selection is the driving force behind evolution."}

{"question_id": 43, "text": "How many lightning strikes occur on Earth each day? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "category": "fermi", "answer": "Lightning strikes occurring on Earth each day are approximately 100 to 160. Lightning strikes occur when there is an electrical charge difference between two areas of different properties. The charge separation causes electrons to be ejected from the negatively charged area and electrons to be attracted to the positively charged area. The electric field between the two areas pulls the electrons until the charge separation is balanced. The speed of these electrons is high enough to create a visible light that we know as lightning. Lightning strikes can occur during a storm, however, they are more likely to occur during thunderstorms. Thunderstorms are the most common weather pattern in the United States. They are caused by atmospheric instability, which can be caused by an increase in moisture, decrease in temperature, or an increase in wind speed. Lightning strikes in the United States are more likely to occur during the summer months. This is because there is a larger amount of moisture in the atmosphere during the summer and thunderstorms are more common. The United States averages 100 to 160 lightning strikes per day."}
