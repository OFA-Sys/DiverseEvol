{"question_id": 3, "text": "What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages?", "category": "generic", "answer": "The main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages are their runtime environments, code syntax, and the level of their abstraction. JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted language, while Python is a low-level, statically typed, and compiled language. Additionally, while JavaScript is used for web and mobile applications, Python is used for general purpose programming. \n\nRuntime environment: JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means the code is executed by the runtime environment before it is compiled. In contrast, Python is a compiled language, which means the code is first compiled into an intermediate language and then into machine code. Therefore, JavaScript applications are usually faster than Python applications.\n\nCode syntax: JavaScript is a dynamic, object-oriented, and event-driven language, while Python is a procedural, imperative, and declarative language. Therefore, Python has fewer built-in functions, while JavaScript has many predefined functions. Additionally, JavaScript code is usually shorter than Python code."}

{"question_id": 11, "text": "What are some potential implications of using a single-use plastic bottle versus a reusable bottle on both the environment and human health?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Using a single-use plastic bottle rather than a reusable bottle has potential implications for both the environment and human health. Single-use plastic can take hundreds of years to break down in the environment, and since they are not biodegradable, they often end up in landfills and the ocean, where they can be ingested by animals. Reusable bottles made from glass or metal are much more environmentally friendly, as they do not create waste and can be recycled. In addition, they do not leach any harmful chemicals into the water and do not release any microplastic particles into the environment. Using a reusable bottle also allows you to be more mindful of the water you are consuming and can help you to drink more water."}

{"question_id": 16, "text": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Gene editing is a process of changing the DNA sequence of a living organism. It can be used to modify or correct genetic defects caused by mutations or to introduce new traits. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing tool that uses an RNA-guided Cas9 protein to target and cut DNA at a specific location. This allows for precise editing of the genome. Gene editing has the potential to improve human health, cure diseases, and enhance the growth of crops. However, its use also raises ethical concerns as the technology can be misused to create genetically modified organisms that may have unintended consequences."}
{"question_id": 17, "text": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Vaccination programs protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases by providing the body with a small amount of an inactivated or weakened version of the virus or bacteria to which it is exposed. This allows the immune system to become familiar with the pathogen and develop defenses against it, such as antibodies that recognise and neutralise it. When a person is vaccinated, they develop immunity to the virus or bacteria and cannot become infected. This protects them from the disease, as well as any other people with whom they come into contact. Vaccination programs also help to create ‘herd immunity’, which refers to the collective immunity of an entire community or population, achieved when a large portion of the population is vaccinated against a particular disease. This reduces the risk of infection for those who have not been vaccinated, as the pathogen is unable to spread to them. Herd immunity also protects those who cannot be vaccinated, such as young children and those with weakened immune systems."}
{"question_id": 18, "text": "How do social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Social media platforms have had a huge impact on the way news is consumed and shared. The rise of social media has led to a greater diversity of sources of news and information, while also reducing the reliance on traditional news outlets. Social media enables users to spread news and opinions quickly and easily, allowing for faster and more comprehensive coverage of current events. This makes it easier for news stories to go viral, but also means that the spread of misinformation can be much faster and wider, making it more difficult to debunk. Social media can also give a voice to groups or individuals who have been traditionally marginalized, but can also be used to spread hate speech or disinformation."}
{"question_id": 19, "text": "How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Cultural, social, and economic factors can influence people's food choices in multiple ways. For example, cultural factors may influence the types of foods that are consumed. In some cultures, certain foods are viewed as more \"prestigious\" and therefore may be more likely to be consumed. Additionally, social and economic factors can influence food choices by altering access to and costs of certain foods. For example, if a community lacks access to healthy foods, then individuals may be less likely to consume them. This knowledge can be used to promote healthier diets by addressing cultural, social, and economic factors that may influence food choices. For example, initiatives could be implemented to increase access to healthy foods in communities with limited access. Additionally, education and awareness campaigns could be developed to raise awareness of the potential influence of cultural, social, and economic factors on food choices."}
{"question_id": 20, "text": "Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Natural selection is the process by which traits that are best suited to an environment become more common in a population over time.

Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "category": "fermi", "answer": "Most winters, between 5 and 10 snowflakes fall per day. This is because snow is formed when water vapor in the atmosphere freezes and falls to the ground as crystals. The number of snowflakes that fall each day depends on the temperature and humidity of the air. Cold air can hold more water vapor than warm air, so if the temperature is below freezing, more snowflakes will be formed. When the air is very humid, it can also lead to more snow. Snowflakes typically form when the air is about 32 degrees Fahrenheit, but they can be formed in much colder temperatures. The size of the snowflakes is determined by the temperature and the amount of moisture in the air. Small snowflakes form in cold temperatures when there is little moisture in the air, while larger snowflakes form in warmer temperatures when there is more moisture."}
