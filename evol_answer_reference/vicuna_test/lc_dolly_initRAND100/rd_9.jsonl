{"question_id": 17, "text": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Vaccinations work by introducing a small amount of an antigen (a weakened or dead version of a disease-causing microbe) into the body. The immune system reacts to this introduction by producing antibodies that recognize and neutralize the antigen. Vaccination is effective because it exposes the immune system to a small amount of antigen, which helps it learn to recognize and neutralize more dangerous doses of that antigen in the future. When a sufficient percentage of individuals in a population have been vaccinated, the disease-causing microbe is unable to spread because individuals with weakened immune systems cannot be infected, and individuals who have not been vaccinated do not have enough antibodies to fight the infection. This is called herd immunity."}
