CRISPR-Cas9 is a protein complex that can be programmed to alter DNA sequences. This can be done by using a piece of DNA (called a guide RNA) that matches a section of the target DNA and recruits the Cas9 protein to that site. The guide RNA can be designed to target any gene of interest and the Cas9 protein can then cut the DNA at that site, allowing the cell's DNA repair machinery to insert the desired DNA sequence in the gap. Since Cas9 is an enzyme, it can be programmed to edit any gene of interest."}
{"question_id": 17, "text": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Vaccinations work by introducing weakened or dead versions of a pathogen into a person's body, which stimulates the immune system to develop antibodies that fight the targeted infection. This process, called active immunity, provides protection against the disease for a person or an animal. Vaccines can also be designed to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against other proteins on the surface of the pathogen, called antigens. By introducing the antigen into the body in this way, the immune system \"remembers\" the pathogen and is able to respond more quickly and effectively when the pathogen is encountered in the future. This type of immunity is known as passive immunity."}

For example, studies show that people living in poverty are more likely to purchase food that is high in fat, salt, and sugar and that people of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to be overweight or obese. In addition, studies show that people from cultures that traditionally consume few animal products are less likely to be overweight or obese, and that people from cultures that consume a greater proportion of animal products are more likely to be overweight or obese. These findings suggest that cultural and socioeconomic factors can influence the dietary needs and food choices of different populations."}
