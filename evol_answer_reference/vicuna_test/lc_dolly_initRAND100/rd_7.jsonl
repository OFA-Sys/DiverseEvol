A quantum computer is different from digital computers based on transistors. Whereas digital computers require data to be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always 0 or 1, quantum information is encoded into quantum bits (qubits), which can be 0, 1, or any superposition thereof. This allows quantum computers to be more powerful than digital computers.\n\nThere are a number of different approaches to building a quantum computer. The most advanced are superconducting qubits and trapped ion qubits. The latter have been used to perform quantum operations on individual particles with high fidelity. The former have been used to build large-scale quantum processors."}
