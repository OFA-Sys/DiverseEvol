{"question_id": 5, "text": "Can you explain the basics of quantum computing?", "category": "generic", "answer": "Quantum computers use quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from digital computers based on transistors. Whereas digital computers require data to exist in discrete binary states, a quantum computer can also operate on data that is in a superposition of states. Additionally, quantum computers can be used to perform certain tasks that are impossible with classical computers or to perform them in an exponentially faster manner.\n\nQuantum computers have a wide range of potential uses, including optimization and simulation. They are expected to be useful for tasks such as finding new molecular structures for pharmaceuticals and materials, optimizing supply chains, and analyzing large sets of data.\n\n###Quantum computers are different from classical computers based on transistors.

{"question_id": 16, "text": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology is performed by introducing a guide RNA (gRNA) that includes a sequence complementary to a DNA sequence to be targeted. The gRNA is then used to direct a Cas9 nuclease to the targeted DNA sequence. The nuclease cleaves the DNA and induces a double-stranded break at the targeted DNA sequence, which can be repaired by the cell to prevent DNA breakage. The cell can also repair the double-stranded break using homology-directed repair, in which a homologous DNA sequence is used as a template to repair the break."}
{"question_id": 17, "text": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Vaccinations work by introducing a small, harmless dose of a virus or bacteria into a personâ€™s body.

For example, a food desert is an area where residents do not have access to healthy food retailers. People living in food deserts typically do not have access to a full-service supermarket and are forced to purchase food from smaller, less-healthy food outlets. The availability of healthy food, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, can influence people's food choices. In addition to the food environment, food choices may be influenced by social and economic factors, such as culture, cost, and accessibility."}
