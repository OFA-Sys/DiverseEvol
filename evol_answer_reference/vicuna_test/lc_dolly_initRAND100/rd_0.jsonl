In the channel, the positive charge of the cloud rises, and the negative charge of the Earth falls. This creates a strong electric field that causes the air to ionize, allowing the charges to move. The lightning bolt that occurs between the cloud and Earth is an electrical discharge that travels along the channel to the ground."}
