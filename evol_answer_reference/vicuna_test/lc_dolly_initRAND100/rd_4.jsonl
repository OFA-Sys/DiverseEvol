{"question_id": 17, "text": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Vaccinations work by exposing the body to an infectious agent in a safe way, which causes the immune system to produce antibodies that provide protection against the disease. For example, the smallpox vaccine exposes the body to a live, but weakened form of the smallpox virus, which leads to development of antibodies against it. Vaccination is especially effective when many people in a community are vaccinated, which is called herd immunity. This is because an infectious disease cannot spread easily through a community if most of the people are immune. Herd immunity prevents outbreaks of infectious diseases and also prevents the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases to people who are too young to be vaccinated or who are medically unable to receive vaccines."}
