Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors and which store data using the two-state quantum mechanical system of a single electron. This is because they are based on quantum mechanics, which enable them to solve certain problems in polynomial time that would take intractable amounts of time on a classical computer."}

{"question_id": 16, "text": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Gene editing is a process that allows for the precise modification of gene sequences in living cells. CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that uses an enzyme to cut DNA at a specific location. The cut DNA can then be repaired with a desired sequence of DNA. CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to modify almost any gene in a cell, including genes implicated in cancer and hereditary disease. Gene editing has the potential to treat genetic disorders, address food insecurity, and even increase crop yields. However, gene editing has also raised ethical concerns such as the potential for gene editing to be used for military and police applications as well as the potential for gene editing to be used to create “designer babies”."}
{"question_id": 17, "text": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Vaccines stimulate the immune system to create antibodies against a pathogen, thereby making the body resistant to future infections. These antibodies are active against those pathogens that have similar surface features to those the body has encountered previously. When a critical mass of people in a population has been vaccinated against a disease, it becomes very difficult for an outbreak of that disease to occur in the community, because those who remain susceptible to the disease (who have not been vaccinated) are easily identified and isolated. This is called herd immunity, and it protects the entire population."}
{"question_id": 18, "text": "How do social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news by allowing users to create and disseminate news and information in a way that is not possible through traditional news media. There are many positive and negative implications for the spread of misinformation through social media. First, social media platforms allow users to share information with a much broader audience than was possible through traditional news media. For example, a single Facebook user can reach over 1,500 people, whereas a newspaper only reaches a few hundred people. This makes it easier for people to spread misinformation, which is more likely to be seen and shared. Second, social media platforms are designed to spread information quickly. This means that misinformation can spread much more quickly than it would through traditional news media, and spread before it can be debunked."}
{"question_id": 19, "text": "How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Social and economic factors such as time availability, cost, and social norms influence food choices.

However, eating healthy food can be affordable. For example, eating vegetables, beans, and whole grains that are less expensive per ounce. \n\nIn addition, people may choose food based on the social norms. For example, people may choose food based on social norms such as cultural foods or foods that are popular in their area."}

{"question_id": 29, "text": "As a space colonist on Mars, describe your daily life and the challenges you face living on another planet.", "category": "roleplay", "answer": "Life on a Martian colony would be very different from life on Earth. The Martian day is longer than Earth's (24 hours, 39 minutes, 35.244 seconds). This means that the sun rises and sets twice a day on Mars, rather than once a day on Earth. This also means that seasons last twice as long on Mars as they do on Earth. On Earth, the seasons last about 90 days. On Mars, seasons last about 188 days.\n\nBecause Mars is much farther from the sun than Earth, it has much less solar energy available to it. This means that life on Mars is much more difficult. People living on Mars would need to wear spacesuits and protective clothes at all times in order to protect themselves from the cold and from radiation damage."}

The first of these 6 shows was on September 27, 2017, at the Schermerhorn Symphony Center, and the conductor was Giancarlo Guerrero. The first show of the season was the Classical Series Opening Gala. This Gala was a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Nashville Symphony, the 125th anniversary of the Tennessee Arts Commission, and the 25th anniversary of the Schermerhorn Symphony Center. The performance was a full-length program with highlights including the Overture to Verdi's Aida and the Sinfonietta from Bartók's Concerto for Orchestra. The Nashville Symphony Chorus joined Giancarlo Guerrero and the orchestra for all the aforementioned pieces, as well as Samuel Barber's Agnus Dei."}
