These changes occur because of genetic variation, which can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. The variation can be based on a variety of characteristics, such as how fast an organism can run, how well it can withstand being eaten by a predator, or how attractive it is to a potential mate.\n\nOver time, the genetic characteristics of the fastest and most attractive organisms will become more common in the population. Other genes will become less common, or become recessive, and the individuals with these characteristics will have fewer offspring. This causes the allele frequency of the fastest and most attractive traits to increase, as the number of offspring with these traits increases in relation to the number of offspring with the other alleles. The traits of organisms do not need to be passed down through sexual reproduction to influence allele frequency, as the alleles can also be passed down through asexual reproduction."}
