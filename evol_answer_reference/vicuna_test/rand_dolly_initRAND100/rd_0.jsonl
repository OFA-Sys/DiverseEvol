A quantum computer is different from a classical computer because it is made of quantum bits, or qubits, which can be in a superposition of 0 and 1 simultaneously. Qubits can also be entangled, which means that the state of one qubit can be affected by the state of another qubit even if the two qubits are far apart."}

{"question_id": 17, "text": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "The body's immune system can distinguish between the body's own cells and foreign cells (bacteria, viruses, etc.), and respond appropriately to each. When a foreign cell is recognized, the immune system will try to remove the cell. This is accomplished by activating a specific set of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which release antibodies against the foreign cells. The antibodies help the body to recognize and destroy the infected cells.\n\nThe lymphocytes then develop memory cells that can fight the same type of virus again, if it attacks the body in the future. The concept of herd immunity explains that an entire population of people can be protected from an infectious disease, even if some people do not receive the vaccine. For example, if a disease is not present in a population, other people are not at risk for the disease. However, if the disease is introduced into the population, the disease will begin to spread, and any individuals who have not been vaccinated against the disease will become infected. This is why it is important for people to be vaccinated against common infectious diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella."}

{"question_id": 19, "text": "How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Food environments and food marketing are important determinants of food choices. However, the food environment has been rapidly changing over the past decades with the expansion of convenience food and the growth of fast food joints. This has resulted in the adoption of a Western diet, which includes a lot of processed food and high sugar/fat content, and is linked to obesity and other health problems. Furthermore, food choice is influenced by cultural factors such as ethnicity and socioeconomic status. For example, some studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to consume fast food than Caucasians. \n\nIn addition to the environmental factors, social and economic factors also influence food choices. For instance, low-income households are more likely to consume foods that are relatively cheaper, such as packaged food and processed meat. Social factors, such as one's social circles, also influence food choices."}
