{"question_id": 16, "text": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "The process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology involves the use of a piece of DNA-cutting enzyme Cas9, and a sequence-specific guide RNA (sgRNA). The Cas9 enzyme and sgRNA are fused together to form the Cas9-sgRNA complex. The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to a target DNA strand base-pair sequence in the genome to form a double-stranded break. The double-stranded break is then repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The DNA repair process introduces mutations into the target DNA strand that lead to the desired changes. The guide RNA sequence can be designed to target virtually any gene sequence that is the desired target for editing. Gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology has the potential to be used in a wide variety of applications from animal husbandry to human healthcare. Gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology also has ethical considerations. CRISPR-Cas9 technology is able to introduce mutations into the genome, making it a powerful tool for genetic engineering."}

{"question_id": 80, "text": "Write a symphony concert review, discussing the orchestra's performance and overall audience experience.", "category": "writing", "answer": "The symphony concert review I attended was a performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 1, \"Titan\", at the Orpheum Theatre, a small venue in downtown Vancouver. The orchestra was the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, a group of about 90 professional musicians, and the conductor was Bramwell Tovey, who is the music director of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The symphony was performed on October 18, 2014, as part of the orchestra's 100th anniversary celebrations.\nThe performance itself was a great success; the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra is a highly skilled, well-trained group of musicians, and Bramwell Tovey is a well-respected conductor. The orchestra’s performance was flawless, and the hall was packed with a diverse audience, including several young people.\nI had a great time at the concert, and the audience had a great time as well. The performance featured a diverse range of emotions, and it was exciting to hear the orchestra go from quiet to energetic, from joyous to contemplative, and back again. The orchestra gave an overwhelmingly positive performance, and the overall audience experience was excellent. I would definitely attend another concert by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and/or Bramwell Tovey."}
