{"question_id": 50, "text": "How many songs have been recorded throughout history? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "category": "fermi", "answer": "The number of songs recorded throughout history is incalculable. However, it is estimated that there are over 13 million different songs in existence. This number is likely to increase as more people record and share their music.\n\nSongs have been recorded for hundreds of years. The first known recordings of music were made in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This allowed for a greater variety of songs to be recorded and shared. Since then, the number of songs recorded has only continued to grow. Technology has made it easier and cheaper to create music, so more people have been able to share their songs with the world. Additionally, the rise of streaming services has allowed people to access music from around the world. This has made it easier to record and share songs, resulting in an increase in the number of songs in existence. It is expected that the number of songs in existence will continue to grow in the future as more people record and share their music."}

It is estimated that the plague killed 35 to 50 million people in Europe alone. The plague is thought to have been caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium, which spreads through flea bites. Without the Black Death, the population of Europe and Asia would likely have grown much more quickly than it did, causing a number of social, economic, and political effects."}
{"question_id": 54, "text": "What if Isaac Newton had focused on biology instead of physics?", "category": "counterfactual", "answer": "If Isaac Newton had focused on biology instead of physics, he might have made important contributions to the fields of biology and medicine. His understanding of physics and mathematics could have been applied to the study of human anatomy, the development and functioning of the human body, and the cause and treatment of diseases. Newton's theories of motion and gravity could have been used to better understand the functions of the heart, lungs, and other organs. His theories of calculus could have been used to develop more accurate mathematical models of the human body. Newton's work in optics could have been used to better understand the eye and vision, and his work in mechanics could have been applied to the study of locomotion and the development of prosthetics. His work in astronomy could have been applied to the study of the human body in space, and his work in physics could have been used to develop new technologies for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Newton's focus on physics and mathematics would not have been a waste of his talents, as he would have still made many important contributions to science. However, his focus on physics and mathematics would not have been as beneficial to biology and medicine as his focus on physics and mathematics."}

{"question_id": 59, "text": "What if Christopher Columbus had not discovered the Americas?", "category": "counterfactual", "answer": "If Christopher Columbus had not discovered the Americas, the world would be a very different place. The exploration of the New World would have been delayed for centuries, and the development of the modern world would have been dramatically different. The global economy would look very different, as the New World provided a wealth of resources for the Old World. Technology would also be delayed, as Columbus' discoveries paved the way for the Age of Exploration and the development of the modern world. The slave trade would also likely be delayed, as the large population of Native Americans in the Americas provided a plentiful supply of labor. The development of modern democracy would also likely be delayed, as the discovery of the Americas provided a new home for many European immigrants, who established new, democratic governments in the New World. The discovery of the Americas would also likely delay the development of the United States, as it provided a new home for so many immigrants. The development of the modern world would also likely be delayed, as the New World provided a wealth of natural resources for the Old World.

There are so many amazing things to do on the island and it's hard to know where to start! Here are three of my favorite things to do while exploring the islands.\n\n1. Snorkeling and scuba diving in Hanauma Bay is a must-do activity. This beautiful bay is home to a variety of colorful fish and coral and it's one of the best places in Hawaii to go snorkeling. There's a small admission fee to get in, but it's worth it to enjoy the crystal clear waters and breathtaking views. It's also a great place to take photos and learn more about the local marine life. I loved exploring the bay and seeing all of the colorful fish and coral up close.\n2. Visiting the Kailua Kona coffee plantations is another great way to experience the local culture and learn more about the island. We had the chance to tour a coffee plantation and learn about the history of coffee growing on the island. It was fascinating to learn about the process of growing, harvesting, roasting and brewing coffee. It's also a great place to enjoy a cup of freshly roasted coffee and take in the beautiful scenery.\n3. Another can't-miss attraction on the island is the Polynesian Cultural Center. This center is a great place to learn about the unique culture and heritage of the Polynesian people.
