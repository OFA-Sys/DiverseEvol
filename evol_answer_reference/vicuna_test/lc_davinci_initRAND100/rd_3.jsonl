{"question_id": 16, "text": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Gene editing is a technique used to modify an organism's genome. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is an efficient and accurate tool for this type of manipulation. It works by introducing a short sequence of RNA into a cell that directs a Cas9 protein to a target location in the genome. The Cas9 protein is an enzyme that can cut DNA at a specific location. It is then able to repair the genome by adding a new DNA sequence at the desired location. This can be used to introduce new genetic information into an organism, or it can be used to remove unwanted sequences from the genome."}
{"question_id": 17, "text": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Vaccinations work by introducing a tiny amount of a weakened or inactive form of a disease-causing agent (the pathogen) into the body. This stimulates the body to produce immunity to the disease without exposing it to the pathogen. Immunity is the state of the body's ability to fight off infection. When there is herd immunity in a community, most individuals have been vaccinated against a disease and are therefore protected from infection. This keeps the disease from spreading through the community and protects those who cannot be vaccinated."}
{"question_id": 18, "text": "How do social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news by allowing them to access and share information in real time. This has led to people using social media as their primary source of news, with many social media users preferring to get their news from friends and family instead of from traditional news sources.\nThe increased prevalence of fake news, trolls, and misinformation on social media has also caused many users to become more wary of what they see on their feeds. In addition, the algorithms used by social media platforms to determine what content users see have led to concerns about the spread of misinformation, fake news, and filter bubbles."}
{"question_id": 19, "text": "How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets?", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Cultural, social, and economic factors all influence people's food choices. These factors can often be linked to health behaviors, such as dietary intake and physical activity. For example, people from certain ethnic groups may be more likely to eat certain foods, such as those high in fat and salt, or to avoid certain foods. Research has shown that people from ethnic groups who consume a traditional diet high in fat and salt are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This is because a traditional diet high in fat and salt can increase blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which can increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, people from some ethnic groups may be at an increased risk of developing a vitamin deficiency due to their diet. For example, people from ethnic groups who consume large amounts of rice or other grains may be at an increased risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency. The reason for this is that rice and other grains do not contain vitamin B12. It is therefore important to consider the dietary patterns of different ethnic groups when assessing the risk of developing a vitamin deficiency. \n\nThe study of the influence of social and economic factors on food choices is called social marketing. Social marketing aims to encourage people to make healthier food choices by using strategies that take into account social and economic factors. For example, social marketing may use price incentives, such as discounts on healthy foods or free samples, to encourage healthy food choices. It may also use social campaigns, such as advertisements or public health messages, to encourage healthy food choices."}

{"question_id": 37, "text": "Why do some people enjoy the sensation of being scared, such as by watching horror movies or going on roller coasters, while others avoid these experiences?", "category": "common-sense", "answer": "Researchers have found that scary experiences can be pleasurable and exciting for some people, while others may feel fear and anxiety. The sensation of fear is caused by the release of chemicals in the brain called catecholamines. Catecholamines, such as adrenaline and dopamine, can cause symptoms of fear in the body, such as a racing heartbeat, increased sweating, and quick breathing. When these sensations are experienced in a controlled and safe way, such as by watching a horror movie, they can be pleasurable and exciting. Research has also found that exposure to scary experiences can actually help to desensitize the fear response, which may explain why some people find scary movies and roller coasters enjoyable. However, when the fear response is experienced in unsafe or uncontrollable situations, such as in the real world, it can be terrifying and cause feelings of anxiety and panic."}

{"question_id": 47, "text": "How many snowflakes fall during a typical winter? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "category": "fermi", "answer": "During a typical winter, there are billions of snowflakes falling around the world. Each snowflake is unique, but most have six sides. This is because a snowflake forms when water vapor freezes in the atmosphere. The water vapor freezes around a small particle of dust or other matter. As the ice crystal grows larger, it takes in more dust and grows in six-sided shape. The average size of a snowflake is 0.5 inches. The winter season lasts from December to March. During this time, the average temperature is 32Â°F. This means that the average snowfall per day is about one inch. This gives a total of about 108 inches of snowfall during an average winter. This means that there are billions of snowflakes falling around the world every day during the winter."}

The filmmakers use special effects and makeup to gradually transform Pitt from an old man into a baby, and vice versa.

He also falls in love numerous times and fathers a son, who grows up and has his own adventures.
