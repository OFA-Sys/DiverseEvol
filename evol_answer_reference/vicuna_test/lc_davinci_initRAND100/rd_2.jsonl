{"question_id": 16, "text": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.", "category": "knowledge", "answer": "Gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology involves the use of a guide RNA molecule to target a DNA sequence within a genome. The guide RNA is designed to include a sequence complementary to a targeted DNA sequence. Once the CRISPR-Cas9 system binds to the targeted DNA sequence, the Cas9 protein acts as a molecular scissor to cut both strands of the DNA at the targeted gene. After the DNA is cut, the cell’s DNA repair mechanisms can be used to correct the DNA sequence. This method of editing DNA has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, such as treating genetic diseases and increasing the yield of agricultural crops. However, the technology also raises ethical concerns because of its potential for misuse and the development of “designer babies.”"}

{"question_id": 43, "text": "How many lightning strikes occur on Earth each day? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "category": "fermi", "answer": "Lightning strikes occur approximately 100 times each day on Earth. Each flash of lightning is caused by the rapid release of energy from a lightning bolt. Lightning occurs most frequently in tropical rainforests and close to coastlines. Lightning strikes are more likely to occur during thunderstorms, when there is a large build-up of electricity in the atmosphere. Lightning is caused by the build-up of charge in the atmosphere due to heating caused by solar radiation. The friction between cooler and warmer air creates an electric charge, which builds up until the charge is discharged as a lightning bolt. Lightning is also caused by volcanic eruptions, which release large amounts of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere. The sulphur dioxide reacts with water molecules to form sulphuric acid. This acid then triggers the creation of ions, which can be discharged as lightning. Each lightning strike is approximately 100 km long and travels at 270,000 km/h. The bolt of electricity can reach a temperature of 30,000 degrees Celsius, which is hotter than the surface of the Sun."}
