Precipitation is water that falls from the atmosphere. The atmosphere is the layer of gases, water vapor, and ice that surrounds the planet. Because snowflakes are a type of precipitation, they fall in the winter. In the winter, snowflakes fall in large quantities because the ground is covered with snow. Because there is so much snow on the ground, the snowflakes fall in large numbers. A typical winter could have thousands of snowflakes falling every day. To explain this, imagine a snowflake falling every second. Each second, another snowflake would fall. If a winter had 1440 seconds each day, there would be 1,440 snowflakes falling each day. 1,440 snowflakes falling each day means that there could be 1,440 snowflakes falling every day."}
