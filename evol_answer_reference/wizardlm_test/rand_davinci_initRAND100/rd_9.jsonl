{"idx": 148, "Skill": "Ethics", "Difficulty": 8, "Instruction": "What are the main ethical theories and how do they differ in their approaches to moral decision making? Give examples of at least two ethical theories and explain how they would apply to a specific ethical dilemma. How do you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different ethical theories?", "answer": "The main ethical theories are utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, and relativism. Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing the overall good and applies to any action that produces the most good. Deontology focuses on following rules and duties, even if it means doing something that produces less good. Virtue ethics focuses on developing good character traits, and relativism considers the morality of an action based on the culture and context in which it takes place. Each theory has its own strengths and weaknesses. Utilitarianism considers the greatest good for the greatest number, but it can lead to moral compromises and it doesn’t account for the consequences of actions. Deontology focuses on duty and respect for rules, but it can lead to inflexibility and a lack of consideration for the consequences of actions. Virtue ethics considers the development of good character, but it doesn’t take into account the consequences of actions. Relativism considers the morality of an action in the context of the culture and society in which it takes place, but it can lead to moral compromises and a lack of universal principles. Each theory can be applied to different ethical dilemmas to help evaluate the morality of an action. For example, a utilitarian approach would consider the consequences of an action and determine whether the good outweighs the harm. A deontological approach would consider the duty to do what is right and the rules that should be followed. A virtue ethics approach would consider the moral character of the person taking the action and the role of the action in the development of good character. A relativist approach would consider the context of the action and the moral standards of the society in which it takes place."}

{"idx": 150, "Skill": "Ethics", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "What are the main ethical principles and values that guide the practice of medicine and health care? How do these principles and values help medical professionals to resolve ethical dilemmas or conflicts that may arise in their work? Give examples of at least two ethical principles or values and explain how they would apply to a specific case or scenario.", "answer": "The main ethical principles and values that guide the practice of medicine and health care are the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy. Beneficence is the principle of doing good, and it requires medical professionals to act in the best interests of their patients. Non-maleficence is the principle of doing no harm, and it requires medical professionals to avoid causing harm to their patients. Justice is the principle of treating people fairly, and it requires medical professionals to ensure that all patients receive equal care. Autonomy is the principle of respecting the patient’s right to make decisions about their own health care, and it requires medical professionals to support patient autonomy whenever possible. These principles and values help medical professionals to resolve ethical dilemmas or conflicts that may arise in their work by providing a framework for making decisions. For example, if a medical professional is faced with the ethical dilemma of whether to treat a patient with a rare but incurable disease, they can use the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice to determine the best course of action. Beneficence requires that the medical professional do what they can to help the patient, non-maleficence requires that the medical professional not cause harm, and justice requires that the medical professional treat the patient fairly and equitably. In this example, it would be beneficent to treat the patient with the rare but incurable disease, non-maleficent to do no harm, and just to treat the patient fairly and equitably."}

Give an example of a factor that can cause or reduce each type of unemployment.", "answer": "Frictional unemployment is a type of unemployment that occurs when workers transition between jobs. It is a normal part of the labor market, and is caused by people moving between jobs, careers, or geographic locations. Structural unemployment is a type of unemployment that occurs when there is a mismatch between the skills and qualifications of the labor force and the needs of employers. Cyclical unemployment is a type of unemployment that occurs during economic downturns. Seasonal unemployment is a type of unemployment that occurs during certain times of the year, such as during the winter holidays when businesses need fewer workers. Frictional unemployment can be reduced by creating better job matching systems and clearer career paths. Structural unemployment can be reduced by investing in education and training programs, and by providing incentives for businesses to hire workers with certain skills. Cyclical unemployment can be reduced by instituting pro-growth economic policies, such as lowering taxes and decreasing government spending. Seasonal unemployment can be reduced by providing temporary employment opportunities during the off-season."}
{"idx": 200, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services over time. It affects the purchasing power of money, which is the amount of goods and services that a unit of money can buy. Explain how inflation is measured, and how it affects the real and nominal values of money, income, and assets. Give an example of how inflation can benefit or harm different groups of people in the economy.", "answer": "Inflation is measured using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is an index that tracks changes in the prices of a basket of goods and services. When inflation rises, the value of money, income, and assets decreases as they can no longer purchase as much as they did before. For example, a raise of 3% may not seem like much, but if inflation is 3%, then this raise is effectively a pay cut. On the other hand, inflation can benefit certain groups of people, such as those who receive a regular income, as their income rises with inflation. It can also benefit those who own assets such as real estate or stocks, as their value increases with inflation."}
{"idx": 201, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 6, "Instruction": "Gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national product (GNP) are two common measures of a country’s economic performance. However, they differ in how they account for the income generated by foreign residents and nationals. Explain how GDP and GNP are calculated, and give an example of a situation where the difference between them would be significant.", "answer": "GDP and GNP are two common measures of a country’s economic performance. GDP measures the total income earned within the country, including income earned by domestic and foreign residents. GNP measures the total income earned by residents of the country, regardless of whether the income is earned within the country or abroad. The difference between GDP and GNP is that GDP includes income earned by foreign residents, while GNP does not. Therefore, GNP will typically be lower than GDP. For example, let’s assume that a country exports $10 billion worth of goods and services, and receives $5 billion worth of income from investments abroad. GDP would be $15 billion, while GNP would be $10 billion. In this example, GDP is greater than GNP because it includes income earned by foreign residents."}
