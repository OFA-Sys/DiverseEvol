KVM, like other virtualization technologies, enables multiple guest operating systems to run on a single host operating system. Unlike Xen, which is also based on the Linux kernel, KVM is capable of providing complete virtualization and is the most popular virtualization solution for cloud computing environments, including OpenStack, OpenShift, and Hadoop. KVM is also a popular choice for DevOps environments, and is used for many of the largest private clouds, such as in Google. KVM is available for most Linux distributions including Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and CentOS, among others.\n\nDocker, also based on the Linux kernel, is another popular virtualization solution for Linux systems. Docker containers provide a lightweight, portable, and ephemeral way to package and manage applications. Containerization is used in many ways, including as a deployment option for web applications, as an application runtime environment, and as a packaging format for Linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host.

Let's say that the data has a size of 100000, and the CPU has a cache of 100000.  If the data is sorted, only 100000 of the entries in the cache are actually in use, so the other 100000 entries in the cache are just wasted space.  If the data is unsorted, then every time the CPU wants to use a data element, it has to go to main memory, do a memory access, and then go to the cache to store the result.  This wastes a lot of CPU time for each element it processes (and it also wastes a lot of memory bandwidth, which is very expensive for the computer).  So, in the best case (when it is using the sorted data), the CPU spends 100000/100000 = 0.1 CPU cycles per element, and in the worst case (when it is using the unsorted data), it spends 100000*100000 = 1000000000 cycles per element.  So, by using the sorted data, it is an order of magnitude faster."}

How would the culture and society of Rome influence the rest of the world? How would the Roman Empire handle the threats and opportunities of other civilizations? How would the Roman Empire evolve over time?", "answer": "The Roman Empire never fell, but it did begin to stagnate. This is because the Roman Empire was based on an agrarian economy. As time passed, agriculture became more and more automated and less and less people were needed to farm. As the population of Rome grew, this meant that Roman society needed to expand beyond the borders of Italy. The Roman Empire invaded Egypt in 30 BC. Rome also expanded in Spain, France, Greece, and Africa. The Roman Empire's greatest expansion was in Britain. However, Britain was a cold, wet, and hostile place to live. The Roman soldiers that were sent there found it difficult to make a profit, and so the Roman Empire lost interest and began to withdraw back to Italy. The Romans did not bother to conquer China because it was too far away. As Rome's borders expanded, so did the borders of the Roman Empire. The borders of the Roman Empire were very large. The borders of the Roman Empire were so large that it became more difficult to maintain control over the borders. Some of the barbarians living on the borders of the Roman Empire began to push farther into Roman lands. Rome was able to defeat the barbarian tribes by using their own tactics against them. The Barbarians would attack during the winter when the Roman soldiers could not fight. Rome began to construct walls to keep the barbarians out of the Roman Empire. The Romans also began to conquer the barbarians by converting them to Christianity. The Romans would convert the barbarians by force to make them obey the Roman Empire. The Romans also began to use the barbarians to expand the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire conquered barbarians by offering them land in exchange for their services. Rome also began to use its new technology to expand the empire. Rome's technology included the Pax Romana, the great roads, and the aqueducts. Rome's technology also included the use of warships and siege engines. Rome's greatest invention was the Roman Legion. The Roman Legion was comprised of Roman citizens who were conscripted into military service. The Roman Legion was very successful in warfare. The Roman Legion was able to conquer the barbarians by using their own tactics against them. The Romans were able conquer the barbarians by using the Roman Legion's Roman tactics against them. The Romans were also able to conquer the barbarians by using the Roman Legion's technology against them.

How do you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different ethical theories?", "answer": "Ethics is the study of right and wrong conduct. Moral decision making is the process of determining what is right and wrong in a given situation. Most people have a framework of general rules that they use to guide their behavior. These rules are usually based on religious or cultural traditions. In addition, there are some moral theories that provide more specific guidance in making moral decisions. The three most prominent moral theories are deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics. These theories differ in the way they approach moral decision making. Deontology is a moral theory that is based on duty or obligation. Deontology is a very strict theory that focuses on following the right rules. This theory requires that an action's morality be determined by its conformity to a set of rules. Deontology is often used by military personnel and law enforcement officers. These people are required to follow very specific rules, and deontology is used to determine the morality of an action. Deontology is often criticized as being rigid and inflexible because it requires a person to follow rules even when it goes against his or her own interests or the interests of others. Utilitarianism is based on the idea that the morality of an action is determined by the effects of that action. According to utilitarianism, the morality of an action is determined by comparing the consequences of the action with the consequences of every alternative. Utilitarianism is also called consequentialism. Virtue ethics is based on the idea that the morality of an action is determined by the virtuousness of the character of the person performing the action. Virtue ethics holds that a person who has a good character will act in a good way. Virtue ethics is often criticized because it is difficult to determine whether a person has a good character."}

Hamlet’s questioning of the validity of the ghost's appearance drives the plot, with the ghost appearing to Hamlet only in the presence of Polonius, Hamlet's father’s old friend, who appears to be hiding behind the arras (a tapestry). In addition, the ghost appears to Hamlet only when he is alone, and not to his mother or to Horatio. Hamlet’s hesitation to kill Claudius causes him to be accused of madness by his mother and girlfriend, Ophelia. Hamlet’s inability to fully confront his uncle and his mother about what he knows is the driving force behind his madness."}

{"idx": 200, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services over time. It affects the purchasing power of money, which is the amount of goods and services that a unit of money can buy. Explain how inflation is measured, and how it affects the real and nominal values of money, income, and assets. Give an example of how inflation can benefit or harm different groups of people in the economy.", "answer": "An economy’s inflation rate is the percentage rate of change of a price index. The inflation rate can be measured with respect to a base period that has a fixed value. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the percentage change in prices of goods and services that are purchased by the average consumer. It is a common measure of inflation in the United States and is used to adjust the Consumer Price Index for inflation in the Cost of Living Allowance for military personnel.\n\nInflation is measured by taking the average price level over a period of time and dividing it by the price level at the start of the period. If the price level in the second period is higher, then inflation is said to be 100% because the price level in the second period is 100% higher than the price level at the start of the period. If the price level is lower, then inflation is said to be -100%. Inflation of 10% means that prices have increased by roughly 10% over the course of a year. This is measured by taking the price level at the end of the year and dividing it by the price level at the start of the year.\n\nInflation affects the value of money, income, and assets. If the price level increases, then the purchasing power of money decreases. The real value of money decreases with inflation. The real value of money is the value of money after taking inflation into account. When the price level decreases, the real value of money increases.\n\nInflation has a negative effect on those who have fixed-income assets, such as bondholders. When the price level increases, the amount of interest income that can be earned on bonds will decrease. This is because the price level is used to calculate the interest rate that is paid on bonds. If the price level increases, then the interest rate will decrease. Inflation also has negative effects on those who receive income that is not adjusted for inflation. Pensioners receive a constant monthly payment, but inflation erodes the purchasing power of that payment. Inflation also has negative effects on those with fixed nominal interest rates on their loans or mortgages. Inflation decreases the real value of the principal on these loans or mortgages. This is known as the inflation tax."}
