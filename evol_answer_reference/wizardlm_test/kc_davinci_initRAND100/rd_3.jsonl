{"idx": 48, "Skill": "Writting", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "Write a persuasive essay arguing for or against the use of social media. What are some of the benefits and drawbacks of social media? How does it affect our relationships, our mental health, and our society as a whole? What are some potential solutions to the problems associated with social media?", "answer": "Social media is a powerful communication tool that has significantly changed the way people interact with each other and access information. While it has many benefits, such as allowing people to stay in touch with family and friends who may live far away, it also has several drawbacks. These include the potential for misuse and abuse, the increased risk of cyberbullying, and the negative impact it can have on mental health. Additionally, research has shown that excessive use of social media can lead to lower levels of happiness and well-being.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, I believe that the benefits of social media outweigh the downsides. For instance, it can be used to spread important information quickly and to organize political activism and protests. It can also be used to promote greater understanding and tolerance among different groups, and to connect people who may not otherwise have the opportunity to interact with one another. Furthermore, it is an unparalleled tool for accessing and sharing information, which can help us to stay informed and engaged with the world around us.\n\nAt the same time, there are steps we can take to help minimize the negative effects of social media. For example, we should strive to limit the amount of time we spend on social media and make sure we are not using it as a way to escape from our problems or to compare our lives with those of others. We should also take steps to protect our online privacy and be mindful of the content we share, as it can have lasting effects on our reputations and relationships.\n\nFinally, it is important that we remember that social media is not a substitute for real-world interactions. We should make sure to spend enough time with people in person so that we can maintain meaningful and personal relationships."}

What are some of the arguments for and against your position? How do you respond to these arguments? What are some of the potential consequences of your position? How does this issue affect people’s lives?", "answer": "I believe that climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity today. There is a growing scientific consensus that human activity is largely responsible for rising global temperatures. The consequences of this warming are already being felt around the world, with increases in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and the extinction of species. Without action to reduce our carbon emissions, these trends are expected to continue and the risk of catastrophic climate change will increase.\n\nOpponents of action on climate change argue that the impacts of global warming are exaggerated and that any efforts to reduce emissions will result in significant economic costs without providing a corresponding benefit. They also point to the benefits of fossil fuels, such as greater energy security and lower costs, as reasons to reject the need for change.\n\nWhile these arguments have some merit, the benefits of taking action far outweigh the costs. It is true that the transition to a low-carbon economy will involve some short-term economic challenges. However, there are also many benefits, such as increased energy security, greater access to clean, renewable energy sources, and reduced air pollution. Furthermore, delaying action means that future generations will be forced to bear the costs of our inaction. Finally, while some may benefit from the continued use of fossil fuels, the effects of climate change will be felt by everyone. No one, regardless of their economic situation, will be immune to the devastating impacts of a changing climate.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential consequences of climate change are too severe to ignore. The evidence is clear that we must take action to reduce our carbon emissions if we want to avoid the worst effects of global warming."}

Describe how data is transmitted and received over a network using concepts such as packets, frames, headers, addresses, ports, sockets, and checksums.", "answer": "A computer network is a system of interconnected computers. It allows computers to communicate with each other and share resources such as data, printers, and the Internet. A computer network can be as small as two or three computers connected to a local area network (LAN) or as large as millions of computers connected to the Internet.\n\nSome of the main components of a computer network are hosts, routers, switches, hubs, and interfaces. Hosts are the actual computers or devices that are connected to the network. They are responsible for sending and receiving data. Routers are devices that route data from one network to another. Switches are networking hardware devices that route data within a network by examining the destination address of the packet and forwarding it to the appropriate output port. Hubs are ancient networking devices that pass data from one port to all other ports. They are now mostly obsolete as they are not a scalable solution and can cause network downtime. Interfaces are the actual connectors on a computer that allow it to be connected to a network. They can be Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or USB.\n\nComputers on a network communicate with each other using a set of rules called protocols. The most common protocols are TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, DNS, DHCP, and ARP. TCP/IP is the main protocol used for communicating on the Internet and consists of four layers: the application layer, the transport layer, the network layer, and the data link layer. HTTP is the protocol used for sending and receiving web pages, while FTP is used for transferring files between computers. DNS is a system that translates human-friendly domain names into computer-friendly IP addresses, while DHCP is a protocol that automatically assigns network addresses to computers on a network. ARP is a protocol used to resolve the IP address of a computer to its physical address.\n\nData is sent from a computer on a network to another computer on the same network by breaking it up into small packets. Each packet contains the destination address and other information needed to route the data to the correct computer. The receiving computer then reassembles the packets into the original data."}

In OOP, data is encapsulated in objects, which can be reused and combined to create complex programs. OOP is a programming approach that emphasizes the use of \"objects\"- self-contained packages of data and associated procedures- to design applications and programmes. Object-oriented programming emphasizes the creation of reusable objects that interact with each other to solve a specific problem. Procedural programming, on the other hand, is a programming approach that focuses on the use of procedures (also known as \"methods\") that are used to carry out specific tasks. In procedural programming, programmers write a set of instructions that the computer can follow to solve a particular problem.

Explain with an example of each and describe how they are used in computer science.", "answer": "A stack and a queue are both linear data structures that store elements in a particular order. The main difference between a stack and a queue is the way in which elements are added and removed from each structure. In a stack, elements are added in a LIFO (last-in, first-out) order, meaning that the newest element is always on top. In a queue, elements are added in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) order, meaning that the newest element is always at the front. A stack is used for tasks that require an orderly procedure in which elements must be retrieved from the top of the structure, and a queue is used for tasks that require an orderly procedure in which elements must be retrieved from the front of the structure. For example, a stack can be used to implement a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack data structure, which is used to store and retrieve elements in a particular order, while a queue can be used to implement a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue data structure, which is used to store and retrieve elements in a particular order."}

Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using a compiler or an interpreter for different types of programs and applications. Give examples of programming languages that use compilers and interpreters and how they are implemented.", "answer": "A compiler is a program that transforms source code from a high-level programming language into a lower-level language that a computer can understand. It takes the source code, analyzes it, and generates a machine language program from it. A compiler generally produces a smaller and faster program than an interpreter, but it requires a more powerful computer and more time to complete the translation process. An interpreter, on the other hand, is a program that executes a high-level programming language directly, without first converting it into a lower-level language. It is much quicker and cheaper to implement an interpreter than a compiler, but it has less control over the output and may not produce as efficient a program. Compilers and interpreters are both used to translate programs from a high-level language into machine code, but they employ different methods to achieve this goal."}

Give  code examples  explain how they differ in terms of syntax, semantics, and design principles. ", "answer": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" as the basic building blocks of software. In OOP, software is composed of self-contained units of code called \"objects\" that have data and behaviour. Objects can interact with each other and communicate through their own methods, which are actions that a object can perform.\n\nProcedural programming is a programming paradigm in which computer programs are written by using procedures or functions that perform a specific task. In procedural programming, programs are composed of a sequence of instructions that are executed in a predetermined order. Each instruction is a step that is carried out to solve a problem. Procedural programming is a more traditional programming style and is often preferred for larger, more complex programs."}

Analyze their time and space complexities using the big-O notation and show me the a easy C++ code example for each one.", "answer": "Bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort are all simple sorting algorithms which compare the elements in a list and swap them if they are in the wrong order. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm which repeatedly steps through the list and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It is easy to implement and has a worst case complexity of O(n^2), but it is very inefficient, as it requires multiple passes through the list to complete the sort. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm which steps through the list and inserts the elements in the correct order. It is also easy to implement and has a worst case complexity of O(n^2), but it is more efficient than bubble sort. Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm which steps through the list and picks out the lowest element and moves it to the end of the list. It is also easy to implement and has a worst case complexity of O(n^2), but is slightly more efficient than insertion sort. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm which takes a large list and breaks it into smaller parts which are then sorted individually. It is a complex algorithm with a worst case complexity of O(n log n), but is much more efficient than the other sorting algorithms. Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm which takes a list and partitions it into smaller pieces which are then sorted individually. It is a complex algorithm with a worst case complexity of O(n log n), but is much more efficient than merge sort. Heap sort is a divide and conquer algorithm which takes a list and builds a heap out of it. It is a complex algorithm with a worst case complexity of O(n log n), but is much more efficient than both quick sort and merge sort."}

{"idx": 69, "Skill": "Computer Science", "Difficulty": 9, "Instruction": "In consideration of the ever-expanding landscape of virtualization technologies and tools available for Linux, which span the spectrum from full virtualization solutions such as KVM and Xen, to containerization platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes, could you provide a thorough analysis of the different virtualization models, including their architectural design, resource isolation, scalability, and management features, and evaluate the benefits and challenges of each of these models for different use cases, such as cloud computing, DevOps, and software development?", "answer": "Virtualization is a technology that allows a single physical machine to be divided into multiple virtual machines, each of which is a separate operating system instance. There are many different virtualization technologies available, each of which has its own benefits and drawbacks. To begin, there are two main virtualization models: full virtualization and paravirtualization. In a full virtualization environment, such as KVM, the guest operating system is completely isolated from the host operating system, and the guest OS behaves as if it is running on its own hardware. In a paravirtualization environment such as Xen, the guest OS is still isolated from the host OS, but it shares some of the underlying kernel code with the host OS, which increases performance and reduces overhead.\n\nFull virtualization provides the highest level of isolation and has the most complete set of features and functionality, but is also the most resource intensive. Paravirtualization is generally more efficient, but it offers a smaller set of features and offers less isolation between guest and host OSs. Additionally, while full virtualization is generally easier to manage, paravirtualization offers better performance.\n\nIn terms of cloud computing and DevOps, full virtualization is commonly used to create a single self-contained environment that can be deployed and scaled up or down as needed. Paravirtualization is often used to create virtual machines that are optimized for use in a multi-tenant environment, such as a cloud infrastructure. Additionally, paravirtualization is often used for containerization, as it is easier to configure and manage than full virtualization."}

In this approach, the agent is trained to interact with an environment and obtain a reward signal based on the correctness of its response. \n\nInitially, the agent should be trained in a simple task, such as asking and answering questions. As the agent becomes more skilled at this task, the complexity of the tasks should be gradually increased. Throughout the training process, the agent should be periodically evaluated to determine whether its performance has improved. If the agent is not able to adequately perform the task, the training process should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAs the agent becomes more proficient at the task, its performance should continue to improve and it should be able to achieve a high level of accuracy and utility. Eventually, the agent should be able to act as a human assistant that surpasses the performance of open assistants such as Siri and Alexa in terms of accuracy, utility, and overall performance."}

How can you identify and evaluate the validity and soundness of arguments based on different types of reasoning? How can you use reasoning skills to solve problems, make decisions, and communicate effectively? Give an example of an argument that uses deductive reasoning and explain its structure and components.", "answer": "There are four main types of reasoning: deductive, inductive, abductive, and analogical. Deductive reasoning is a type of logical argument that uses a set of premises to arrive at a conclusion that is certain or almost certain to be true. Inductive reasoning is a type of logical argument that uses observations to make predictions about the future or to generalize from the specific to the more broadly applicable. Abductive reasoning is a type of logical argument that uses evidence to infer the most likely explanation for a phenomenon. Analogical reasoning is a type of logical argument that makes comparisons between two or more things to reach a conclusion. Deductive reasoning is often considered to be the most sound type of reasoning because it involves a true premise leading to a logically certain conclusion. Inductive reasoning is also considered to be a valid type of reasoning because it involves inferring the likelihood of something from a set of observations. Abductive reasoning is a type of valid reasoning because it also involves inferring the likelihood of something from evidence, but it is not as strong an argument as inductive reasoning since it does not involve statistical certainty. Analogical reasoning is generally not considered to be a valid type of reasoning because it involves comparing two things that may have little in common and making a generalization based on the comparison."}

It is generally faster to process an array in order, even if it's not sorted, than it is to process it out of order. This is because the CPU can take advantage of its cache and other optimization techniques to better exploit the relationship between adjacent elements in memory.

Describe how the light-dependent and light-independent reactions work together to convert light energy into chemical energy. Give examples of factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis and how plants adapt to different environmental conditions.", "answer": "Plants use photosynthesis to produce their own food. This process involves the conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Photosynthesis involves the combined efforts of two main processes: the light-dependent reaction and the light-independent reaction. The light-dependent reaction uses the energy from sunlight to split water molecules and produce oxygen gas. This reaction also produces sugar, which is the end product of photosynthesis. The light-independent reaction uses the released energy from the splitting of water molecules to combine carbon dioxide with the sugar produced in the light-dependent reaction to form glucose. This reaction does not require sunlight and occurs in the chloroplasts of plants. Together, the light-dependent and light-independent reactions allow plants to create their own food and store energy for future use. \nPlants adapt to different environmental conditions by varying the rate of photosynthesis. For example, plants in hot and dry environments tend to close their stomata (tiny pores in the leaves that regulate gas exchange) to prevent water loss, which slows down photosynthesis. Plants also lose less water when the air is humid, which allows them to maintain higher rates of photosynthesis. In addition, plants have developed many adaptations to maximize the amount of light they can use for photosynthesis, including the production of reflective structures such as leaves and the growth of thicker, more protective stems and leaves."}

HIIT is an effective way to improve aerobic fitness, burn fat, and boost athletic performance. Compared to traditional endurance training, HIIT results in greater improvements in VO2 max, which is the maximum amount of oxygen the body can use during exercise, as well as in cardiovascular fitness and muscle endurance. HIIT also increases metabolic rate and can help reduce the risk of developing many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\n\nHIIT has several advantages over other forms of aerobic exercise, such as jogging, cycling, or swimming. First, HIIT workouts are much more efficient in terms of time and energy expenditure, allowing athletes to work out more intensely and for a shorter period of time. Second, HIIT offers unmatched mental benefits, such as increased focus and mood, which can help to improve performance. Finally, HIIT is a great way to improve fitness and endurance quickly, which is especially beneficial for athletes who are preparing for a competition."}

How do these differences affect the way the games are played? Which sport do you think is more physically demanding and why? Please provide examples to support your answer.", "answer": "The main difference between American football and rugby is in the rules of play. American football is a more scoring-focused game, with teams able to score points by advancing the ball down the field and kicking it into the opposing team's end zone. In rugby, teams must advance the ball from their own half of the field to the opposing team's goal line by running or passing the ball, and can score points by kicking the ball through the goal posts. Another difference between the two sports is the number of players on the field. In American football, there are 11 players on each team, while in rugby there are 15. Additionally, in American football, players are allowed to use their hands to catch and pass the ball, whereas in rugby, players are only allowed to use their hands to carry the ball. These differences in rules of play have a significant impact on the way the games are played, making American football a much more physical and scoring-oriented sport. Additionally, American football is much more widespread in terms of popularity and participation."}

Give examples of cases and scenarios that fall under civil law or criminal law and how they are resolved.", "answer": "Civil law and criminal law are two different areas of law that deal with disputes and offenses involving individuals, groups, or the state. Criminal law refers to the body of laws that defines crimes, sets punishments, and regulates the state's relationship with the individual. It is enforced by the government and is designed to protect society from harmful and illegal behavior. Criminal law covers acts such as murder, theft, assault, and drug trafficking. It is concerned with penalizing individuals who violate criminal laws and imposing punishments such as fines, jail time, or both. Criminal law is enforced by the state through the courts and law enforcement agencies. Civil law, on the other hand, refers to a body of laws and regulations that private citizens use to resolve disputes and apply for remedies. Civil law is designed to resolve issues such as contract disputes, property disputes, and torts (such as personal injury or wrongful death). Civil law is enforced by the government, but it is mainly concerned with resolving disputes between individuals and does not involve the potential for criminal punishment. Civil law is usually handled by the courts, but it can also be settled by private arbitration or mediation. Both civil and criminal law use the same sources of law, such as constitutions, statutes, regulations, and judicial precedents. However, the main difference between criminal and civil law is the purpose of each system: criminal law is designed to punish individuals for breaking the law, while civil law is designed to resolve disputes between private citizens."}

How can diabetes mellitus affect other organs and systems in the body?", "answer": "Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the body cannot properly regulate its blood glucose (sugar) levels. It is caused by either the body's inability to produce insulin, or the inability to use insulin properly. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body's complete inability to produce insulin. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and is often due to an autoimmune reaction that destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, meaning that the body is unable to use insulin properly. It is most often seen in adults, but can develop at any age. It is often associated with obesity and lack of physical activity, and can sometimes be controlled through diet and exercise. Both types of diabetes can lead to serious complications if left untreated, including damage to blood vessels, nerves, and organs.

In contrast, jazz, rock, and pop music often emphasize a more immediate, emotionally-driven sound, and are often more accessible to a wider audience. Jazz, for example, is typically characterized by its improvisational nature, unique rhythms, and use of instruments such as the saxophone and the electric guitar. Rock music is often based around a strong rhythm section, a catchy melody, and an electric guitar solo, while pop music is often focused on a catchy hook and a simple, accessible melody.

How do you identify the key of a song based on its scale?", "answer": "There are seven basic musical scales: major, minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor, whole tone, diminished, and chromatic. Each scale is made up of a certain arrangement of notes that creates a distinctive sound and mood. In major scales, the notes are ordered in a specific pattern, with the first note of the scale being the root note and all other notes ascending in a particular pattern. In minor scales, the notes are ordered in a different pattern, with the first note of the scale being the root note and all other notes descending in a particular pattern. Harmonic and melodic minor scales are minor scales with additional notes that create a more melodic sound. Whole tone scales are made up of six equally spaced notes, which creates a unique sound. Diminished and chromatic scales are both based on the notes of a major or minor scale, but they contain notes that are neither major nor minor in feel. \n\nIn popular music, the major scale is the most common scale used. It is the basis for many popular songs and is often used in a variety of styles, including rock, pop, and country. The minor scale is also commonly used in popular music, particularly in genres such as jazz, blues, and folk. The harmonic and melodic minor scales are also used in popular music and are often used to create a more expressive or melancholy sound.

{"idx": 198, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of a market economy and a command economy?", "answer": "A market economy is an economic system in which most of the decisions are made by individuals through the free interaction of supply and demand. It is a system based on the private ownership of the factors of production and the operation of free markets to determine the distribution of goods and services. The main advantage of a market economy is that it allows individuals and businesses to respond to changing conditions and to attempt to maximize profits, which ultimately benefits consumers by creating more goods and services at lower prices. The main disadvantage of a market economy is that it does not take into account the broader social and environmental impacts of economic activity. In contrast, a command economy is an economic system in which most of the decisions are made by the government rather than by individuals and businesses. Under a command economy, the government controls the production and distribution of goods and services, and prices are set by the government rather than by the forces of supply and demand. The main advantage of a command economy is that it can achieve greater economic control and efficiency. The main disadvantage is that it can lead to shortages, inefficiency, and lower living standards."}

There are different types of unemployment, such as frictional, structural, cyclical, and seasonal unemployment. Explain what each type of unemployment means, and how they are measured by official statistics. Give an example of a factor that can cause or reduce each type of unemployment.", "answer": "Frictional unemployment is a type of unemployment that occurs when people are transitioning between jobs or moving to a new location. It can be caused by factors such as job seekers looking for a more suitable position, individuals changing careers, or workers who are between jobs. Structural unemployment is a type of unemployment that occurs when there is a mismatch between the type of jobs available and the skills needed to perform them. It can be caused by factors such as outdated technology, unfavorable economic conditions, or a decline in demand for certain goods and services. Cyclical unemployment is a type of unemployment that occurs during economic downturns. It is often caused by a reduction in demand for goods and services, as well as businesses cutting back on production and laying off workers. Seasonal unemployment is a type of unemployment that occurs during certain times of the year, such as during harvest seasons or when schools are on break. It is often caused by factors such as the weather or the monthly cycle of business activity."}
{"idx": 200, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services over time. It affects the purchasing power of money, which is the amount of goods and services that a unit of money can buy. Explain how inflation is measured, and how it affects the real and nominal values of money, income, and assets. Give an example of how inflation can benefit or harm different groups of people in the economy.", "answer": "Inflation is measured as a percentage change in the price level. It is calculated by comparing the price level in a given period with the price level in a base period. The price level is calculated by adding up the prices of all goods and services in the economy and then dividing by the amount of a basket of goods and services that is representative of the economy as a whole. Inflation affects the real value of money, income, and assets by reducing their purchasing power. When inflation is high, the real value of money and income decreases, and the value of assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate also decreases. Inflation can benefit some people in the economy, such as those who receive a fixed income such as a salary or pension, as it increases the spending power of their income. However, it can also harm those who have debts, as it increases the real cost of repaying them."}
{"idx": 201, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 6, "Instruction": "Gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national product (GNP) are two common measures of a country’s economic performance. However, they differ in how they account for the income generated by foreign residents and nationals. Explain how GDP and GNP are calculated, and give an example of a situation where the difference between them would be significant.", "answer": "Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given year. It is calculated by adding together the value of all the final goods and services produced in the economy, minus the value of any goods and services used up in the production process. Gross national product (GNP) is a similar measure, but it also includes income earned by residents working abroad. As such, GNP is generally higher than GDP, as it includes income earned by citizens of the country, even if they are living and working in another country.\n\nThe difference between GDP and GNP can be significant in countries that have a large number of citizens working abroad. For example, if a large number of U.S. citizens move to work in other countries, the U.S. GDP would likely be lower than if those same individuals worked in the U.S. However, the U.S. GNP would be higher, as the income earned by those citizens working abroad is included in the total."}

The proposed model consists of a hierarchical encoder for web text representation, and two cascaded selectors to select the most explainable sentences for verdicts. The hierarchical encoder consists of a sentence encoder followed by a token representation layer. The sentence encoder is a bidirectional LSTM network with attention mechanism. The token representation layer is a stack of three 2D convolutional layers with max pooling in between. The output of the token representation layer is then fed into the two cascaded selectors. The first selector consists of two bidirectional LSTM networks, which are used to extract key words for verdicts. The second selector consists of a cascade of three 1D convolutional layers, followed by a max pooling layer, and a fully connected layer, which is used to extract the verdict sentence. The output of the second selector is then used as the verdict for the fake news detection task. We have conducted extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed model.

What are the functions and types of transitions and signposts in academic writing? How can you use them to connect your ideas and guide your reader? An example of a paragraph that lacks transitions and signposts is:\n\nThe main cause of global warming is the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and warm up the Earth’s surface. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. It is produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. The more fossil fuels we burn, the more carbon dioxide we emit.\nYou need to polish the paragraph.", "answer": "The main causes of global warming are the greenhouse effect and the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that keeps the Earth warm and causes the surface to be habitable. It occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat and radiation from the sun in the Earth’s atmosphere, causing the temperature to increase. The more greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere, the more heat is trapped and the warmer the Earth becomes. This is because greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are long-lived in the atmosphere and continue to trap heat for many years. The continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions is the main cause of global warming.\n\nAnother important factor is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. These fossil fuels contain carbon, which when burned, is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The more fossil fuels we burn, the more carbon dioxide we emit and the higher levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will become. The combination of increased greenhouse gas levels and the warming of the Earth due to the greenhouse effect is causing global temperatures to rise, leading to climate change and increasing the risk of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts."}
