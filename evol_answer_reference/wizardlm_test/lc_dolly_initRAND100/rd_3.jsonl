Hubs are network devices that forward packets based on the physical address of the link on which they travel, but broadcast all data to all other ports. Links are the physical connections such as copper wire and fiber optic cable that connect hosts to routers and switches. Interfaces are the actual connections on the network hardware such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi that carry data between hosts and switches. Protocols and standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, DNS, DHCP, and ARP define how data is transmitted and received over a network.

{"idx": 191, "Skill": "Music", "Difficulty": 8, "Instruction": "What are the main characteristics of classical music? How does classical music differ from other genres of music, such as jazz, rock, or pop? Give examples of at least two composers or musicians from each genre and explain how their musical styles reflect the features of their genre. How do you appreciate and evaluate different genres of music?", "answer": "The three main characteristics of classical music are tonality, sonata form, and development. Tonality refers to the key in which the musical work is written. In classical music, tonality is a principle of harmony that dictates that a music work should be in a key with a tonic chord as its final chord. Sonata form is a musical structure that is used in instrumental music, particularly in large-scale instrumental works of the Classical era and in some works of the Romantic period. Sonata form contains three sections: the exposition, the development, and the recapitulation. The development section is the most important part of sonata form because it is used for musical development. Development is any part of a musical work such as a piece of music, movement, or song, in which the music is deliberately made more complex.

{"idx": 199, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "Unemployment is a situation where people who are willing and able to work cannot find a job. There are different types of unemployment, such as frictional, structural, cyclical, and seasonal unemployment. Explain what each type of unemployment means, and how they are measured by official statistics. Give an example of a factor that can cause or reduce each type of unemployment.", "answer": "Frictional unemployment is when people who are unemployed are looking for a job and are therefore temporarily unemployed. Structural unemployment is when a mismatch exists between the skills of the workforce and the jobs available. Cyclical unemployment is when the economy is in a recession, which reduces the amount of work available. Seasonal unemployment is when unemployment increases during certain times of the year, such as during a holiday season. Frictional, structural, and seasonal unemployment are all types of unemployment that are measured by official statistics. Frictional unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate. Structural unemployment is measured by the labor force participation rate, which is the number of people working or looking for work as a percentage of the total population. Seasonal unemployment is measured by the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate. A factor that can cause or reduce frictional unemployment is job searching. A factor that can cause or reduce structural unemployment is a mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the jobs available. A factor that can cause or reduce seasonal unemployment is the season in which a job is offered."}
{"idx": 200, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services over time.

{"idx": 212, "Skill": "Academic Writing", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "This paper proposes a novel neural network for explainable fake news detection based on raw reports from different media outlets. The proposed model consists of a hierarchical encoder for web text representation, and two cascaded selectors to select the most explainable sentences for verdicts. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art detection baselines and generates high-quality explanations from diverse evaluation perspectives. The paper also presents two explainable fake news datasets, which are publicly available.\n\n1. Could the authors provide more detailed information on the implementation process of the proposed method?\n2. Could the authors conduct more extensive evaluation and ablation studies to support the proposed method's performance?\n3. Could the authors compare the proposed method with more widely-known baselines in the field?", "answer": "1. The proposed model consists of a hierarchical encoder for web text representation and two cascaded selectors to select the most explainable sentences for verdicts. The hierarchical encoder first encodes the web text to a fixed-length representation via a bidirectional LSTM, then the representations are flattened and fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to obtain sentence representations. The MLP is composed of a 1-D convolution layer, a max pooling layer, and a linear layer. The two selectors are then applied to the sentence representations to select the most explainable sentences for verdicts. The first selector is a classification layer with a sigmoid activation function, the second selector is a ranking layer with a softmax activation function. The two selectors are applied sequentially, and the verdict is generated by the most explainable sentences."}
