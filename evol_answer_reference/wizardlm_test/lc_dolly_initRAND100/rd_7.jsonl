Containerization platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes use isolation and abstraction to improve the efficiency of multi-tenancy and resource utilization. Full virtualization is generally more efficient than containerization because it abstracts the guest OS from the host OS more completely and relies on hardware-assisted virtualization features instead of software-based isolation.

Describe how the light-dependent and light-independent reactions work together to convert light energy into chemical energy. Give examples of factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis and how plants adapt to different environmental conditions.", "answer": "Plants use photosynthesis to produce their own food by converting carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates (sugars) using the energy from a photon of light. The process is highly efficient and can be described in stages. The light-dependent reaction is the conversion of light energy into the chemical energy of NADPH and ATP. The light-independent reaction is the conversion of NADPH and ATP into the carbohydrates that store energy in the form of sugars. The reactants in these two reactions are carbon dioxide and water. All plants use photosynthesis to make their own food, but they do it in different ways that are adapted to their environment. For example, plants that live in water use a specialized structure called a hydrophytic leaf to conduct photosynthesis underwater. Plants that live in the desert use a specialized leaf called a caudex to conduct photosynthesis during droughts. Plants that live in shady areas also have specialized leaves called leaf shadows to conduct photosynthesis in low-light conditions."}

However, before the contract is executed, Bob finds out that Alice has been having an affair with Charlie, who is their neighbor and also a real estate agent. Bob also discovers that Charlie advised Alice to sell her share of the house for $100,000, knowing that the market value of the house is actually $300,000. Bob feels cheated and wants to rescind the contract with Alice. Can he do so? What are the legal issues involved in this scenario?", "answer": "Alice and Bob entered into a contract to sell Alice's share of the house for $100,000. The contract was governed by the law of contracts, so the parties could not rescind the contract unless they had a legal ground to do so.

The first is that the contract was induced by fraud (Charlie advised Alice to sell the house for $100,000 knowing that the market value of the house was actually $300,000). The second is that the contract was unconscionable (Alice did not disclose to Bob that she was having an affair with Charlie). Rescinding the contract would be difficult because the contract was executed and there would be no evidence to prove that Charlie induced Alice to sell her share of the house for $100,000.

{"idx": 212, "Skill": "Academic Writing", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "This paper proposes a novel neural network for explainable fake news detection based on raw reports from different media outlets. The proposed model consists of a hierarchical encoder for web text representation, and two cascaded selectors to select the most explainable sentences for verdicts. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art detection baselines and generates high-quality explanations from diverse evaluation perspectives. The paper also presents two explainable fake news datasets, which are publicly available.\n\n1.
