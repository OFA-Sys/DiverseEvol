Give examples of factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis and how plants adapt to different environmental conditions.", "answer": "Plants use the energy from sunlight to combine carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis to produce glucose. The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis use the energy from sunlight to form an electron transport chain in chloroplasts, which drives the formation of ATP. The light-independent reactions use the electrons from the electron transport chain to reduce carbon dioxide to glucose, releasing oxygen in the process. Factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis include the amount of light, the temperature, the presence of certain substances, such as nitrogen, and the amount of available CO2. Plants adapt to changes in their environment by changing the number of leaves or stems, or by making other structural changes, such as increasing the size of the stomata."}

Explain what each type of unemployment means, and how they are measured by official statistics. Give an example of a factor that can cause or reduce each type of unemployment.", "answer": "Frictional unemployment is caused by factors such as moving, job searching, or changes in job market conditions. Cyclical unemployment is caused by economic downturns. Structural unemployment is caused by technological changes or labor market changes. Seasonal unemployment is the result of downturns in certain industries."}
{"idx": 200, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services over time. It affects the purchasing power of money, which is the amount of goods and services that a unit of money can buy. Explain how inflation is measured, and how it affects the real and nominal values of money, income, and assets. Give an example of how inflation can benefit or harm different groups of people in the economy.", "answer": "Inflation is measured as a percentage change in the price level. The nominal value of money, income, and assets is measured in real terms by adjusting them for inflation using the price level. The real value of money can be either greater or less than the nominal value, and the same goes for income and assets. Higher inflation benefits those who have money in the form of cash or short-term bonds, since it reduces their real value. Lower inflation benefits those who have long-term bonds or future income, since it increases their real value."}
{"idx": 201, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 6, "Instruction": "Gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national product (GNP) are two common measures of a country’s economic performance.

Also, please reference the sources of your knowledge.", "answer": "Quantum Physics is the branch of science that deals with the study of the very small. At the microscopic level, physical laws undergo radical change. For example, matter can no longer be seen as being composed of particles but must be thought of as being made up of waves. This is called the wave-particle duality. It is not possible to know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. This is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When a particle interacts with another particle it is impossible to say with certainty which particle is the cause and which particle is the effect. This is called the indeterminacy principle."}

{"idx": 213, "Skill": "Academic Writing", "Difficulty": 8, "Instruction": "The method section of your paper is too brief and does not explain how your proposed model works in detail. How can you provide more details of the hierarchical encoder and the cascaded selectors, such as their architectures, inputs, outputs, and parameters? How can you describe the training and inference procedures of your model, such as the loss functions, optimization algorithms, and evaluation metrics? How can you illustrate your model with a clear and informative diagram?", "answer": "Our hierarchical encoder is a stack of transformer blocks, with each layer consisting of a multi-head attention network with residual connections. The cascaded selector is a sequence of attention-based selector networks, with each layer consisting of a multi-head attention network with residual connections. The inputs to the encoder are the visual feature maps of the input image, and the input to the selector is the output of the previous layer. We employ the categorical cross-entropy loss for training. We use the mean-squared error as the loss function for inference. We use the InceptionNet (2016) as the visual feature extractor. We use the same visual feature extractor for both training and inference. We use the Adam optimizer with a weight decay of 0.0005 for training. We use the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for training, and we update the model parameters after each mini-batch of training examples. We use the mean over the batch loss as the training loss. We use the mean over the batch loss as the validation loss. We use the mean over the batch loss as the test loss. We use the Pearson correlation metric as the evaluation metric. We use a batch size of 64 for training, 128 for validation, and 256 for testing. We use the same batch size for training, validation, and testing."}
