{"idx": 213, "Skill": "Academic Writing", "Difficulty": 8, "Instruction": "The method section of your paper is too brief and does not explain how your proposed model works in detail. How can you provide more details of the hierarchical encoder and the cascaded selectors, such as their architectures, inputs, outputs, and parameters? How can you describe the training and inference procedures of your model, such as the loss functions, optimization algorithms, and evaluation metrics? How can you illustrate your model with a clear and informative diagram?", "answer": "The proposed hierarchical encoder consists of a 2-level hierarchical encoder with cascaded selectors at the top level and bottom level, respectively. The architectures of the selectors are ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively. The inputs of the hierarchical encoder are the RGB, flow, and spatio-temporal features. The outputs of the hierarchical encoder are the 2-level feature maps with a different size at the top level and bottom level. The encoder is trained with the loss function of the 2-level feature maps. The inference procedure of the hierarchical encoder is to generate the 2-level feature maps from the RGB, flow, and spatio-temporal feature inputs. The evaluation metric of the hierarchical encoder is the per-pixel classification accuracy on the Cityscapes validation set. The proposed cascaded selector consists of 2 cascaded selector modules. The architecture of the first selector module is ResNet-18 and the architecture of the second selector module is ResNet-34. The inputs of the first selector module are the 2-level feature maps and the inputs of the second selector module are the 2-level feature maps from the first selector module. The outputs of the first selector module are the first selector feature maps and the outputs of the second selector module are the second selector feature maps. The 2 selector feature maps are then concatenated and fed into the cascaded selector loss function. The inference procedure of the selector is to get the first selector feature maps and the second selector feature maps from the cascaded selector loss function. The evaluation metric of the selector is the per-pixel classification accuracy on the Cityscapes validation set. The full cascaded selector is trained with the loss function of the first selector feature maps and the second selector feature maps. The proposed model is trained with the loss function of the 2-level feature maps and the selector feature maps."}
