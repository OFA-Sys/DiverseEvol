Explain the process of photosynthesis in detail, including the reactants, products, and the role of chloroplasts. Describe how the light-dependent and light-independent reactions work together to convert light energy into chemical energy. Give examples of factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis and how plants adapt to different environmental conditions.", "answer": "The process of photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The overall process can be divided into two main reactions: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, light is absorbed by chlorophyll and used to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugar and oxygen. In the light-independent reactions, the sugar is used to make carbohydrates and the oxygen is released. The light-dependent reactions require a lot of energy but only take place in the presence of light, so they are not very efficient. The light-independent reactions are much more efficient and do not require light, so they are used to regenerate the light-dependent reactions when they run out of energy. The light-independent reactions use the sugar to make carbohydrates and release oxygen."}

{"idx": 200, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 7, "Instruction": "Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services over time. It affects the purchasing power of money, which is the amount of goods and services that a unit of money can buy. Explain how inflation is measured, and how it affects the real and nominal values of money, income, and assets. Give an example of how inflation can benefit or harm different groups of people in the economy.", "answer": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of inflation. It is calculated by taking price changes for a fixed basket of goods and services and dividing them by the price of that same basket from the previous year. This method of calculating inflation is called the \"chain-weighted\" method. The CPI measures inflation in a particular country, and does not take into account relative price changes between countries. For example, if the price of pizza in the United States increases by 10% and the price of pizza in Canada increases by 5%, the CPI would show 10% inflation in the United States and 5% inflation in Canada.\n\nIncreased inflation benefits debtors and harms creditors. This is because interest rates are typically set on an agreed upon fixed rate basis. If the CPI increases, the real value of the interest payments that debtors must make to creditors will decrease. This will allow debtors to pay off their loans more quickly, and it will also increase the value of the principal amount of the loan for debtors. For example, if a 4% interest rate loan has a principal amount of $100, then a 10% inflation rate would increase the value of that loan to $110. In this scenario, the borrower pays back $110 to the lender, and the lender receives $110 in interest payments. This would be an example of how inflation benefits debtors and harms creditors."}
{"idx": 201, "Skill": "Economy", "Difficulty": 6, "Instruction": "Gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national product (GNP) are two common measures of a country’s economic performance. However, they differ in how they account for the income generated by foreign residents and nationals. Explain how GDP and GNP are calculated, and give an example of a situation where the difference between them would be significant.", "answer": "GDP takes into account the income earned in a country by its citizens (or residents) and the income earned by its citizens (or residents) abroad. GNP takes into account the income earned in a country by its citizens (or residents) and the income earned abroad by its citizens (or residents). A key difference is that GDP includes the income earned by foreigners in the country, but GNP does not. For example, if a Japanese citizen works in the US, the income he earns in the US will be counted in Japan's GDP and Japan's GNP, but not in the US' GDP or GNP."}
