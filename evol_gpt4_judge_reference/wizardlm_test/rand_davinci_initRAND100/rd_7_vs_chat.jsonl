Assistant 1's answer was concise and to the point, correctly stating that oxidation is the loss of electrons and reduction is the gain of electrons. However, Assistant 2's answer was more detailed and comprehensive, explaining not only the basic concepts of oxidation and reduction but also how to identify which process occurs in a redox reaction by analyzing the changes in oxidation states. This additional information makes Assistant 2's answer more helpful for someone trying to understand these concepts.
