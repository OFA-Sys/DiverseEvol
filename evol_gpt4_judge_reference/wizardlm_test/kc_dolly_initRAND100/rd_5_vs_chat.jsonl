The ability to rescind a contract often depends on the specific circumstances, such as evidence of fraud, duress, or undue influence.

The assistant also made a contradictory statement, initially stating that Bob can rescind the contract, but later suggesting that the contract is irrevocable because it is for the sale of land. This could confuse the user. Furthermore, the assistant incorrectly stated that Bob would lose the $100,000 he paid Alice if he rescinds the contract. In reality, if a contract is rescinded, both parties are generally restored to their original positions before the contract was made, which would likely include Bob getting his money back.
