The assistant started off correctly by stating that both weights are the same, but then went on to incorrectly suggest that 100 pounds of feathers would be heavier if you measure weight as the force that pushes up against an object against the surface of the Earth. This is incorrect because weight is defined as the force exerted by the gravity on an object, and it does not change based on the type of material. The assistant's explanation about the force of the air pushing up against the feathers is also misleading, as this force (buoyancy) would actually make the feathers appear lighter, not heavier.
