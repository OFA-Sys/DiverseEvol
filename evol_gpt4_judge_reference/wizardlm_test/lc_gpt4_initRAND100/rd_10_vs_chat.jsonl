However, this arrangement does not reflect the proportionality between the number of books and the size of the label.

The assistant provided a solution without any explanation or reasoning, which is not helpful to the user. Furthermore, the solution is incorrect. The assistant seems to have simply reversed the order of the number of books on each shelf, which does not make the number of books proportional to the size of the label.
