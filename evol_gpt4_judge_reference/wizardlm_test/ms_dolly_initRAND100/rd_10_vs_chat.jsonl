The assistant then multiplies these non-existent values to suggest a new number of books for each shelf, which is not only impossible (since the library doesn't have that many books), but also doesn't answer the question because it doesn't suggest a way to rearrange the shelves.

The assistant suggests a way to rearrange the shelves, but doesn't explain why this arrangement would make the number of books proportional to the size of the label.
