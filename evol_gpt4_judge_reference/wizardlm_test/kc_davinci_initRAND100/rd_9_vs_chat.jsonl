On the other hand, Assistant 2's explanation was not entirely accurate. The assistant incorrectly stated that sorting an array creates a new, sorted version of the array and puts it into the cache. This is not how sorting or caching works. Sorting rearranges the elements in the existing array and does not automatically put the data into the cache.
