They incorrectly stated that in oxidation, an atom or molecule gains electrons and becomes positively charged, and in reduction, an atom or molecule loses electrons and becomes negatively charged. This is the opposite of the correct definitions. They also incorrectly stated that the reaction of copper with oxygen gas to form copper (II) oxide is not a redox reaction, when in fact it is. Copper is oxidized and oxygen is reduced in this reaction. Therefore, Assistant 2's response was less accurate and less helpful than Assistant 1's response."}
