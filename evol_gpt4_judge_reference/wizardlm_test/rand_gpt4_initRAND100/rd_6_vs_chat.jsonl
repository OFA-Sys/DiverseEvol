The `ORDER BY` clause is correct in ordering the data, but it should be used in conjunction with other functions to get the desired result. \n\nAssistant 2's answer is more accurate and helpful. The use of the `MAX` function in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause is a common way to retrieve the last record in each group, especially when the records can be ordered by a date or numerical column.

The assistant correctly explains how to use the GROUP BY and MAX functions to return the last record in each group of a table.
