The LAST_VALUE function doesn't necessarily return the last value in each group when used with GROUP BY. It returns the last value in a window frame, which is not the same as a group. The window frame needs to be defined using the OVER clause, which is not mentioned in the response. Therefore, the provided query might not work as expected."}
