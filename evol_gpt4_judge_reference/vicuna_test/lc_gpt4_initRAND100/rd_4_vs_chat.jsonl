They both explained how vaccinations work by introducing a weakened or dead form of a disease-causing pathogen into the body, which allows the immune system to recognize and develop a defense against that particular pathogen. They also both explained the concept of herd immunity, stating that when a certain percentage of a population is vaccinated against a particular disease, it becomes difficult for that disease to spread within the community. This is because the vaccinated individuals act as a barrier, preventing the disease from spreading to those who are not vaccinated or who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons.
