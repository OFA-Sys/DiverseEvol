The assistant starts by stating an estimated number of books in the world, which is a good start. However, the assistant then makes a leap to say that the total number of words in all these books is around 1.5 exabytes, and then equates this to 1.5 billion gigabytes of words. This is a misuse of the term 'exabyte', which is a unit of digital storage, not a measure of word count. The assistant then makes another leap to say that if these books were printed as individual pages in a book, each page would have an area of approximately 1 inch by 1 inch. This is not a standard size for a book page, and it's unclear how the assistant arrived at this figure. The assistant then concludes that there are approximately 129,864,880 pages in all the books ever written, which is the same number as the estimated number of books.
