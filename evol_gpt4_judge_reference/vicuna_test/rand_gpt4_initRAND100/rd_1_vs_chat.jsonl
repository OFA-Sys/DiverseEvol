The assistant started by stating that there is no single, authoritative answer to the question, which is true. However, the assistant then made an assumption that 80% of mobile subscribers worldwide use text messaging, without providing any source or basis for this assumption. The assistant also made a calculation error when dividing the number of texting subscribers by the number of seconds in a minute, which resulted in an estimate of 100 million text messages sent every minute globally.
